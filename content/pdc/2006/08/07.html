   RIFF files to GIF. With some help from the Apple Support Discussions web site, I
   have finally come up with a workable solution. I am going to describe it here,
   partly because I expect I shall need reminding when I need to perform this task,
   in about a year’s time.
</p>

<h2> Save as GIF</h2>
<p>The toughest part is persuading Corel Painter to save a file as a GIF, under the
   control of my program. Here I present the working version of the procedure that
   does that. 
</p>
<p>We start by activating Painter and then talking to it via the System
   Events thingie (the UI scripting component):
</p>
<pre><code>(* Attempt to write the front-most image as a GIF file.
Will fail if there is already a file of that name. *)
on save_front_image_as_gif(gifs_folder)
    tell application "Corel Painter 8"
        activate
    end tell

    tell application "System Events"
        tell process "Corel Painter 8"
            click menu item "Clone" of  menu 1 of menu bar item "File" of menu bar 1
</code></pre><p>Why clone the image? To avoid the extra dialogue that Painter throws up warning
   me that there is more than one layer in the picture. I would then have to work
   out how to make AppleScript program recognize this dialogue and dismiss it.
   The cloned image has only one layer, which avoids the dialogue.
</p>
<p>Now we show the Save As dialogue:
</p>
<pre><code>            click menu item "Save As..." of menu 1 of menu bar item "File" of menu bar 1
</code></pre><p>One of the things I did not know how to discover was the precise spelling of
   ‘Save As...’: was the ellipsis a single Unicode character U+2026 (&#x2026;) or
   just three dots (...)?  they look the same on the screen, and Apple’s UI Element Inspector does
   not allow me to copy and paste the text.  In the end the <a href="http://www.prefab.com/uibrowser/">UI Browser</a> from
   PreFab solves this problem for me: it shows the incantation needed to click the
   menu item in a proper text box.
</p>
<p>The next problem is ensuring that the GIF is saved in the correct directory.
   There is a way to do this, by faking an obscure keyboard shortcut: control-/
   shows a dialogue for entering a directory name. The parameter <code>gifs_folder</code> will
   be a Finder file object, and we have to convert that to a directory name using
   an incantation I had to learn from via Google:
</p>
<pre><code>            (* Set the output directory using an obscure keyboard shortcut. *)
            keystroke "/" using {control down}
            delay 1
            tell window 1
                set gifs_dir_name to POSIX path of (gifs_folder as alias)
                set value of text field 1 to gifs_dir_name
                click button "Go"
            end tell
</code></pre><p>I don’t know why ‘<code>as alias</code>’ is required; it just is.
</p>
<p>Our next task is to trim the prefix <code>Clone of</code> from the file name.  The <code>delay
1</code> seems to be required to ensure that we don’t ask for the value before the
   dialogue’s initialization code has finished running.
</p>
<pre><code>            tell window "Save"
                (* Edit the file name to not start with ‘clone of’ *)
                delay 1
                set the_file_name to value of text field 1
                if the_file_name starts with "Clone of " then
                    set the_file_name to text 10 thru (length of the_file_name) of the_file_name
                end if
                set the value of text field 1 to the_file_name
</code></pre><p>Finally, we need to tell it to save as GIF. The problem here was that the menu
   button I needed to manipulate is inside a panel that UI Element Inspector said
   was <code>unknown</code>. You can’t refer to a widget using the word <code>unknown</code>, since
   <code>unknown</code> is a keyword. From the kind people on the <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=580232&tstart=0">Apple Discussions
forums</a> I discoverd that the things that are called ‘controls’ in Windows and
   ‘widgets’ on Unix systems are called ‘UI elements’ on the Mac, and that you can
   get a list of all UI elements using the AppleScript reference <code>every UI
element</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>                (* Set the file format to GIF *)
                click pop up button 1 of UI element 9
                click menu item "GIF" of menu 1 of pop up button 1 of UI element 9
</code></pre><p>Now that is done it is time to click Save and then deal with the GIF Options
   dialogue that appears next.  When the file is saved we close the window
   containing the cloned image, and also the image we started with.
</p>
<pre><code>                click button "Save"
            end tell

            delay 1
            tell window "Save as GIF Options"
                click radio button "16 Colors"
                if value of checkbox "Interlaced" = 0 then
                click checkbox "Interlaced"
                end if
                keystroke return
            end tell

            (* Now close the document we just saved. *)
            delay 1
            keystroke "W" using command down

            (* Now close the document we cloned in the first place. *)
            delay 1
            keystroke "W" using command down
        end tell
    end tell
end save_front_image_as_gif
</code></pre><p>That was the hardest part of getting the script to work. All we need to do now
   is work out which files need updating, and then open each file in turn and
   invoke that procedure.
</p>

<h2> Walking the Directory Tree, or Searching the Folder Hierarchy</h2>
<p>To look for files my AppleScript program talks to the Finder. The technique is
   pretty standard: we keep a list called <code>pending_folders</code> of folders that have
   not been scanned yet; at first this contains just the starting directory. As we
   scan a directory, we add its subdirectories to the list. When the list is empty,
   we are done.
</p>
<p>Because AppleScript dates back to Mac OS 9, and the old Macintosh file system
   had its own way of writing file names, and because file names in AppleScript are
   objects rather than mere strings, you need translate your nice Unix file names
   in to Mac OS 9 format: as an example, <code>/Users/pdc/foo</code> becomes <code>folder
"Users:pdc:foo" of startup disk</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>tell application "Finder"
    set desired_count to 1000
    set root_folder to folder "Macintosh HD:Users:pdc:foo"
    set pages_folder to folder "pages" of root_folder
    set gifs_folder to folder "External Disc:PRINT:gifs"

    set processed_count to 0
</code></pre><p>There is a complication because AppleScript does not appear to have a way to
   remove an item from the list if the list contains only one item! <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html" title="EWD831">E. W. Dijkstra
argues that life is easier if lists are numbered starting at 0</a> and ranges are
   defined to include their lower bound and not their upper bound; AppleScript gets
   both of these wrong. There are several ways to work around this problem; the
   approach I used was to add an extra element to the list so that it never goes
   below one element.
</p>
<pre><code>    set pending_folders to {pages_folder, "–worst programming language EVAR–"}
    repeat while processed_count &lt; desired_count and length of pending_folders &gt; 1
        set a_folder to item 1 of pending_folders
        set pending_folders to items 2 thru (length of pending_folders) of pending_folders
        set more_folders to every folder of a_folder
        set pending_folders to more_folders &amp; pending_folders

        set riff_files to every document file of a_folder whose file type = "RIFF"
        repeat with riff_file in riff_files
            if my maybe_process_file(riff_file, gifs_folder) then
                set processed_count to processed_count + 1
                if processed_count &gt;= desired_count then
                    exit repeat
                end if
            end if
        end repeat
    end repeat

    if processed_count &lt; desired_count then
        display dialog "ThatÕs all, folks"
    end if
end tell
</code></pre><p>What’s all that fuss with <code>processed_count</code> and <code>desired_count</code> about? I
   added all that so that while I was testing the script I could change
   <code>desired_count</code> to limit the script to creating only one file: that way, if it
   went horribly wrong, the number of spurious files to clean up would be small.
</p>

<h2> Processing One File (Maybe)</h2>
<p>The function <code>maybe_process_file</code> checks whether the file that has been found
   needs to be processed or not.  In this case, ‘processed’ means saving the GIF
   version in <code>gifs_folder</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>to maybe_process_file(riff_file, gifs_folder)
    tell application "Finder"
        set gif_name to name of riff_file
        if gif_name ends with ".rif" then
            set gif_name to text 1 thru ((length of gif_name) - 4) of gif_name
        end if
        set gif_name to gif_name &amp; ".gif"
        set is_gif_needed to (not (exists document file gif_name of gifs_folder))
</code></pre><p>The parameter <code>riff_file</code> is a Finder file-name object; <code>name of</code> gives the last
   component of its full file name (such as <code>bar.rif</code>, or, in a few cases, just
   plain <code>baz</code>, with no suffix).  We set <code>gif_name</code> to this with <code>.rif</code> changed to
   <code>.gif</code>, and then check whether this file already exists.
</p>
<p>Even if the file exists, it is possible that it is out of date. This happens
   when the RIFF file is updated and the GIF has not been updated yet. We check for
   this by asking Finder for the modification dates of the files.  If an
   out-of-date file exists, then we delete it now; if we did not, then when we go
   to save the file, an extra dialogue box would appear, asking us whether we want
   to overwrite the exsting file, and this would cause our script to fail.
</p>
<pre><code>        (* Also process file if GIF is older than RIFF *)
        if not is_gif_needed then
            set gif_file to file gif_name of gifs_folder
            set riff_time to modification date of riff_file
            set gif_time to modification date of gif_file
            if gif_time &lt; riff_time then
                delete gif_file
                set is_gif_needed to true
            end if
        end if
        if is_gif_needed then
            my process_file(riff_file, gifs_folder)
            return true
        end if
        return false
    end tell
end maybe_process_file
</code></pre><p>This procedure and the loop for walking the folder hierarchy are fairly generic:
   they could be used for any task that needs to do something for every file in a
   set of folders. The only  thing we would need to change to do a
   different ‘something’ is <code>process_file</code>. This part is  quite short:
</p>
<pre><code>to process_file(riff_file, gifs_folder)
    tell application "Finder" to open riff_file
    my save_front_image_as_gif(gifs_folder)
end process_file
</code></pre><p>That’s pretty much it. The main things I need to remember from this are:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     ‘UI element’;
 </li>

 <li>
     UI Element Browser (it helps a lot!); and
 </li>

 <li>
      <code>POSIX path (... as alias)</code>.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>Once this script was working it takes several hours to convert the couple of
   hundred drawings I have. Still, now it’s done once, it will take much less time
   to update the pile o’ GIFs when only a small number of RIFFs have been edited.
