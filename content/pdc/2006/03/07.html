<p class="first"> <a href="http://turbogears.org/">TurboGears</a> and the <a href="../../2006/python imaging library" title="python imaging library">Python Imaging Library</a> make writing
   applications that allow the reader to upload
   pictures a snap—which is a refreshing change.
</p>

<h2> About the Problem</h2>
<p>Handling picture uploads in a web application used to be
   complicated—most frameworks handled file-upload forms as an
   afterthought, or in some cases, not at all (ASP required third-party
   extensions, I seem to recall).  Often conventional form parameters are offered as
   strings in a dictionary that cannot handle other datatypes; an entirely
   separate mechanism must be used to handle uploads.
</p>

<h2> Capturing Uploads the TurboGears Way</h2>
<p>TurboGears, through CherryPy, makes uploads easy, and uses the same
   mechanism to pass uploaded files as any other form parameter:
</p>
<pre><code>@turbogears.expose(html="picky2.templates.addpicture",
                validators={’id’: validators.Int()})
def filepic(self, id, pic):
</code></pre><p>The important difference is in the page that contains the add-picture
   form:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;Add a picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;form action="filepic?id=${panel.id}" method="post" 
        enctype="multipart/form-data" id="filepic"&gt;
    ...
    &lt;label for="pic"&gt;Picture file:&lt;/label&gt; ...
    &lt;input type="file" name="pic" id="pic"/&gt;
   ...
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre><p>The essential differences are (1) the <code>enctype</code> attribute on the <code>form</code> element,
   and (2) an <code>input</code> element with <code>type="file"</code> and (in this case) name <code>pic</code>. You
   can have other form parameters, and so far as your controller method is
   concerned they work as normal.
</p>
<p>These changes mean that the <code>pic</code> argument passed to my <code>filepic</code> method is a
   file-upload object, sketchily  documented as part of Python’s <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/node471.html">cgi module</a> and
   in section 3.1.6 of <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/cherrypy-2.1.0/docs/book/chunk/ch03.html">Chapter 3 the CherryPy book</a>.  It has three interesting
   member variables:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
      <code>file</code>: a file-like object from which we can read the data;
 </li>

 <li>
      <code>filename</code>: the name used for this file on the user’s computer; and
 </li>

 <li>
      <code>type</code>: the MIME media-type of the file, as reported by the user’s computer.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>The file-name offered can be used, but we have to be cautious because we don’t
   know whether the file-name conventions on the user’s computer are suitable for
   our purposes: it might be something arcane like <code>/Users/pdc/Pictures/kitten.jpg</code> or
   something ‘easy to use’ like<br/><code>C:\Documents and Settings\pdc.OCC\My
Documents\My Pictures\kitten.jpg</code>.
</p>

<h2> Storing the Picture Once it Has Arrived</h2>
<p>Let’s step through the <code>filepic</code> method in order. In the Picky2 game, pictures
   are uploaded as candidates for a panel.  Our database model includes <code>Panel</code> and
   <code>Picture</code> classes, and we pass the identifier of the current panel as one of the
   parameters. The first thing we do is retrieve our person and panel info from the
   database:
</p>
<pre><code>def filepic(self, id, pic):
    pers = authentication.getLoggedInUser()
    panel = model.Panel.get(id)
    ...
</code></pre><p>We could store the picture directly in the database. At work, we always end up
   doing that, because we a re terrified that one day we might need to migrate the
   application to a different server, and would have to remember to copy the files
   as well as the database itself, which apparently is an easy thing for database
   admins to forget. Nevertheless for Picky2, I intend to keep metadata in the
   database and store the picture data on disc. So I need to generate a file name
   for it.<br/>
</p>
<p>We concoct the file name on the web server from a combination of the following:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><p>The date of upload (turned in to a directory name like <code>2006/03/07/</code>);
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>The identity of the uploader (munged into a directory  name,so that
   <code>http://example.org/jsmith</code> becomes <code>example.org-jsmith</code>);
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>The last component of the file name from the user’s home computer (so each
   of the examples I gave above end up with <code>kitten.jpg</code>).
</p>

 </li>
</ul>
<p>This gives something like <code>static/2006/03/07/example.org-jsmith/kitten.jpg</code>. The
   reason for the directory structure is that eventually we might have hundreds or
   thousands of pictures, and keeping them all in one directory might make looking
   up files inefficient. (This is a little silly because I am anticipating
   scaleability issues that are unlikely to manifest given how obscure my game will
   be, and besides, <a href="http://www.namesys.com/">ReiserFS</a> has BTree-based directories that do not degrade in
   performance when they have enormous numbers of files.)
</p>
<p>It also helps to avoid
   assigning the same file name to pictures from different people. It does expect a
   given person to avoid choosing the same name on the same day for different
   pictures, though I ought to add something to cope with that case, in order to make the
   program more robust.
</p>
<p>We want to cap files saved on our system to a given maximum
   size (say 50K bytes).  We do this by carefully only reading 1 byte more than the
   maximum size, and rejecting files that completely fill the buffer:
</p>
<pre><code>    output = open(fileName, ‘wb’)
    try:                
        size = 0
        bytes = pic.file.read(1 + MAX_FILE_SIZE)
        while bytes:
            size += len(bytes)  
            if size &gt; MAX_FILE_SIZE:
                raise BadPictureException(’Sorry, that file is too big: maximum size is %dK.’ 
                        % (MAX_FILE_SIZE // 1024))
            output.write(bytes)
            bytes = pic.file.read(1 + MAX_FILE_SIZE - size)
    finally:
        output.close()
</code></pre><p>This code assumes that <code>pic.file.read</code> may not read all the bytes in the file in
   one gulp—I have not checked whether this caution is actually required. the
   important thing, though, is that if the file is too big, we throw an exception
   <code>BadPictureException</code>. The above code is actually wrapped in a <code>try</code>...<code>except</code>
   block. Anywhere we need to reject the uploade we raise a <code>BadPictureException</code>
   with an appropriate error message. The handler for the exception cleans up the
   unwanted file and redirects back to the page with the form on it:
</p>
<pre><code>try:
    ... read in the file as above ...
    ... process the file ... 
    return dict(...)
except BadPictureException, err:
    # The uploaded picture was unsatisfactory; issue a message and try again.
    os.unlink(fileName)
    turbogears.flash(str(err))
    raise cherrypy.HTTPRedirect(’panel?id=%d’ % id)
</code></pre><p>This is an example of a function that throws exceptions that it catches itself
   (so that the clean-up code need only be written once). This is a cleaner
   structure than endlessly nested <code>if</code> statements.
</p>

<h2> Processing Images</h2>
<p>Another constraint on images is that they have a certain maximum size. We can
   check this by using <a href="../../2006/pil" title="pil">PIL</a>, the Python Imaging Library.
</p>
<pre><code>    im = Image.open(fileName)
    width, height = im.size
    if width &gt; MAX_WIDTH:
        raise BadPictureException(’Sorry, that picture is too wide: maximum is %d pixels.’ 
                % MAX_WIDTH)
    if height &gt; MAX_HEIGHT:
        raise BadPictureException(’Sorry, that picture is too tall: maximum is %d pixels.’ 
                % MAX_HEIGHT)
</code></pre><p>If we wanted to generate thumbnails, this is where we would do it.
</p>
<p>What we do do is save a pointer to the newly created file in the database.
   Having added some extra classes to <code>model.py</code>, the code to do this is quite
   short, because <a href="http://sqlobject.org/">SQLObject</a> magically adds them to the database when
   we create the obejcts:
</p>
<pre><code>picture = model.Picture(uri=PICS_BASE_URI + picDir + name, 
        width=width, height=height, panel=panel, score=1, person=pers)
model.Vote(picture=picture, person=pers, value=1)
</code></pre><p>The second statement adds a vote from this user for their picture. Like Reddit, we
   assume that people only upload panels if they think they are good enough to be
   worth voting for. (They can unvote for their panel later if they really want
   to.)
</p>
<p>Finally, like all CherryPy methods, we return a dictionary that is used by the template to
   create the HTML page:
</p>
<pre><code>return dict(picture=picture, panel=panel)
</code></pre><pre><code>
</code></pre>
