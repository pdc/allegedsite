Some of the photos have come out looking good, but it’s noticeable that even a pretty sensitive camera like mine (ASA 1600) is not a patch on the miraculous ability of the human eye to pick out details in a mixture of darkness and flickering firelight: at the risk of stating the obvious, you really had to be there to get the full effect.  I can’t wait to see what professional photographers have made of this spectacle.&lt;br clear="all" /&gt;</content>

Half the street is roped off and filled with mysterious metal sculptures. Judging from the non-decorative finish on the equipment, it seems they are part of some pyrotechnic display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The street has become one-way for the interim, which is slightly inconvenient as this means I need to come up with a new commute route.&lt;br clear="all" /&gt;</content>

I felt a little odd wearing my heavy winter gloves with short sleeves, so for once I cycled with with naked hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before that I had been chasing after a bunch of guys on spring-loaded stilts (presumably promoting a brand of spring-loaded stilts, or perhaps a company that provides spring-loaded-stilt-related services). As is usually the case with mad phenomena dancing through the streets of Oxford, most of my shots are of them leaving.&lt;br clear="all" /&gt;</content>

    &lt;br&gt;Virtuoso lightsaber dueling from  the people who I would imagine  brought us &lt;cite&gt;Ryan vs Dorkman&lt;/cite&gt; at some point in the past.  (Via &lt;a href="http://www.korvar.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/2007/03/ryan-vs-dorkman-ii.php"&gt;my baby brother&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fan filmdom stripped to the bare essentials: there are no attempts to tie it in with the plot or characters of &lt;cite&gt;Star Wars&lt;/cite&gt;, or even to emulate their costuming: the opening scene is the two combatants striding in to an ordinary-looking factory floor in their ordinary-looking clothes.  Who are they?  Why do they fight?  We aren’t told.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given my usual complaint about the prequels was that you don’t care about the duels because you don’t particularly care about the characters, my first thought was that I would find this even sparser story uninvolving, but actually it was really entertaining—thrilling in places and with a couple of scenes that made me laugh out loud at their clever use of the Jedi conventions. It’s like seeing your favourite indy band playing unplugged, bringing the  skills of the performers to the fore because there are no distractions.</content>

    <content type="html">British residents and British subjects can sign &lt;a href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/iplayer/"&gt;e-Petition to tell the BBC not to dig itself any deeper in to the mire of proprietary DRM&lt;/a&gt;.  Bad enough they use REAL player already.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the BBC really must have time-limited copy-prevention on its output then it has the resources to commission a good-enough system that it can make publicly available: this would allow anyone (such as new bands) to make their own time-limited demos for diffusion over the internet.  Using a system under the control of a foreign power is failing in their duty to make content available to British people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying to undestand the BBC Trust's &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/research/iplayer_public_value_test.html"&gt;BBC iPlayer Public Value Test&lt;/a&gt; but without spending some days reading through the many thick documents I can't be sure what, if anything, I am supposed to do to send them comments or even what their plans actually are.  The summary of the summary of the Provisional Conclusions does mention that a non-Microsoft-specific solution would cause less damage to the market. Does this imply they already are aware of the issue?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/press_releases/31_01_2007.html"&gt;press release from the BBC Trust&lt;/a&gt; says they will have to work towards a platform-agnostic system within a reasonable timeframe (whatever that means).  So this e-petition may be behind the times.</content>

I can now type away upstairs with not a single cable plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got myself an AirPort Extreme. This is intended to replace three existing things: my existing AirPort Express, the LinkSys router that sits between my network and the cable modem, and the not-entirely-working NAS. So far results are mixed—it works with the PowerBook as a wireless router and also lets Jeremy’s borrowed laptop to access the Internet, but I am having trouble getting my Nokia N800 Internet Tablet to connect to it.

Jo´s electric double bass was clearer in the mix this time so I could follow her part and watch her hands as she played the fiddly bits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witches (if that´s the right spelling) followed and were pretty cool: four guitars, drums, plus a trumpet for that hint of Ennio Moriconi. It being a school night, I snuck off before Rock of Travolta.</content>

In this case, Xportz has also gone to the trouble of theming the Windows apps to have a similar look to the Mac OS X apps, but some people may prefer to keep them visually distinct. So: switching to a Mac no longer means you have to abandon your business-critical Windows-only applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news the next version of Microsoft Windows &lt;a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/vista_cost.txt"&gt;will be hobbled with copy-prevention features&lt;/a&gt; that will cost a lot to implement and will reduce the usefulness of Windows Vista as a video and music player.&lt;br clear="all" /&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">I have a printer that I am unable to plug in to any of my computers because it requires a  Centronics (parallel) connector and modern computers do not bother with such bulky legacy connectors.  So I bought a print server: a little box a little larger than a box of matches that contains a tiny computer complete with printer queue, web server, and IPP service, which turns your wired printer into a network printer.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending an hour rearranging the junk in the studio to allow the printer to be placed on the desk, I have discovered that I cannot plug it in, because of a gratuitous flange built in to the printer’s tidy outer enclosure.  I cannot use one of my two printer cables to join the server and the printer via a cable, because printer cables—in common with USB cables—have different types of connector at each end (in contrast to serial cables, which have male and female versions of the same connector, and FireWire cables, which are the same at each end, which is a fantastic design accomplishment).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My choices are either to buy a gender changer or non-standard Centronics cable with two ‘printer-side’ connectors, or to take a hacksaw to my venerable laser printer.</content>

    <content type="html">In 1988 I was posting to the rec.arts.comics newsgroup and Alan Moore had written a comic that revealed that Swamp Thing was not a man transformed in to a monster after all -- he was a monster who merely thought he had been a man once.  All the old &lt;cite&gt;Swamp Thing&lt;/cite&gt; stories still happened, but their interpretation had suddenly altered.  I suggested the term &lt;cite&gt;retcon&lt;/cite&gt; for this use of retroactive contiinuity to change the interpretation of a character wile leaving the old stories standing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-odd years later, and I have been added to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retcon"&gt;the  entry for &lt;cite&gt;retcon&lt;/cite&gt; in Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;retcon&lt;/cite&gt; has appeared in print in comics like &lt;a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/profile/profile.php?sku=13-851"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Escapists&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and on television in &lt;cite&gt;Torchwood&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;cite&gt;Torchwood&lt;/cite&gt; reference is kind of amusing.  In the first episode, Jack says vaguely that they protect their secrets (what secrets?) with a bit of misdirection, a bit of retcon, a bit of miso soup or something to that effect.  Plainly he is using retcon figuratively in the comic-booky sense of the word: revising someone's backstory.  In the ep in which someone kills several people so she can comes back from the dead and kill her dad, we learn that Retcon is the name of the drug they use to adjust people's memories.  This is a change from episode 1, added to explain away Jack's use of an overly geeky vocabulary.  &lt;em&gt;They retconned 'retcon'!&lt;/em&gt;</content>

It is an 'interesting' design decision that it tells me which parts of the world are subject to the GMT time zone, which I happen to know already, but neglects to mention something I would have found more immediately useful, which is the day of the week of the meeting.  Luckily I own a dektop calculating device called a calendar which tells me the meeting is schedulded for a Tuesday.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jamglue.com/"&gt;Jamglue&lt;/a&gt; is a new on-line remixing community: you can upload tracks, remix them in a snazzy-looking Flash-based mixing desk, and, they claim, Rock Out.  If LiveJournal suppresses the embedded player above this paragraph, visit &lt;a href="http://www.jamglue.com/mixes/642"&gt;the remix page for ‘Help Me Sombody’&lt;/a&gt; to see how neatly they present the mix and list the tracks it is made from.  Highly educational! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now a quick stupid audio tech question.  Suppose someone, let’s call her Alice, has a bunch of 3-minute clips recorded at telphone quality (8 kHz sample rate, 8-bit samples, mono), and wants to embed them in &lt;s&gt;Macromedia&lt;/s&gt; Adobe Flash, which requires that audio clips have a sample rate of 11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz or 44.1 kHz.  Is it possible to resample to 11.025 kHz without totally losing the sound in aliasing artefacts?  So far her attempts to save it at 44.1 kHz sound much worse than the original 8 kHz audio—there are spiky glitchy noises which I assume are because of aliasing.  I don’t know much about this stuff, but I suspect that clever filtering is required because there is no simple ratio between the two sample rates.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

On the other hand, there is a certain amusement value to hanging out in Butlins drinking champagne coctails, staring at the rain-swept amusements, and trying to track down the last copy of the &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt; in Minehead—and we got to got to a Iggy Pop performance, which was just amazing.&lt;br clear="all" /&gt;</content>
