<div></div><p class="first">I thought I might have a go at familiarizing myself with <a href="http://turbogears.org/">TurboGears</a>, one of the new
   Python web frameworks, by writing a new and improved clone of the 
   <a href="http://caption.org/picky/">Picky Picky Game</a>.  Step one was verifying that I can upload pictures
   easily.  Step two was getting an identity system put together.  Creating
   a registration page and log-in form and so on is the obvious and dull
   solution, so I thought I’d have a go at exploiting <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> instead.
</p>

<h2> But what is OpenID?</h2>
<p>Don’t you hate having to learn a new username and password whenever you
   want to play on a new web site? Well, the people at <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a>
   thought you might, so they concocted a system where you (and only you)
   use your LiveJournal URL as your log-in name on other sites.  If
   you are <code>alice</code> on LiveJournal, then your OpenID identifier is
   <code>http://alice.livejournal.com/</code>.  It isn’t restricted to LiveJournal,
   either; anyone can run their own identity server.
</p>

<h2> Come to Think of it, what is TurboGears?</h2>
<p> <a href="http://turbogears.org/">TurboGears</a> is yet another entrant in Python’s notoriously crowded
   web-frameworks competition. TurboGears is actaully a sort of Frankestein
   creation—rather than designing its own quirky template, database and
   controller conventions, TurboGears uses established, <em>lightweight</em>
   libraries like <a href="http://kid.lesscode.org/language.html">Kid</a>, <a href="http://sqlobject.org/">SQLObject</a>, <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/">CherryPy</a>, and <a href="http://www.mochikit.com/">MochiKit</a>.
   I had already been thinking it would be nice to swap the Picky Picky
   Game’s home-brewed templating system with Kid and its controller
   framework with CherryPy, so finding them nicely packaged up together as
   TurboGears looks very attractive!
</p>
<p>I am not going to attempt to write a TurboGears tutorial here; there is already
   the <a href="http://files.turbogears.org/video/20MinuteWiki2nd.mov">20-minute Wiki</a> movie and a fine <a href="http://docs.turbogears.org/1.0/Wiki20/Page1">TurboGears tutorial</a>. What I will do
   here is outline the code I wrote. If you, gentle reader, are a web developer who
   does not already know TurboGears, I hope it will give you a flavour of the
   brevity of TurboGears code.
</p>

<h2> Step Zero: Install, Install, Install</h2>
<p>Installing TurboGears is a little adventurous on Mac OS X.  The first
   thing you have to do is upgrade Python to version 2.4 (since even the
   latest Mac OS X revision has Python 2.3), and even the <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> web
   site is mum on how to achieve this.  In the end the packages the
   TurboGears web site points to worked fine.  The process of installing
   TurboGears itself (via something called Easy Install) also worked fine.  Most
   of the time was spent reading the documentation.
</p>
<p>Then I decided I wanted to be able to use the latest SQLite as my
   database driver. This required me to actually install Unix packages from
   source, something I have gotten out of the habit of, what with everyone
   supplying fancy installers and Mac OS packages. This required nothing
   more than the incantations I remember from when I did everything on
   GNU/Linux boxes:
</p>
<pre><code>./configure
make
sudo make install
</code></pre><p>In the same fashion, installing the Python drivers is very similar,
   except that Python has its own  idiom:
</p>
<pre><code>python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install
</code></pre><p>I tested this had installed it where Python could find it by starting up
   python and doing <code>import pysqlite2</code>.
</p>
<p>I was fully prepared to roll my own OpenID library based on the
   specification—I have done the same with <a href="http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt" title="HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication">RFC 2617</a> three times over—but a
   little poking about on the OpenID site pointed me to a Python library
   <a href="http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/libraries/python">Python-OpenID</a>.  Cool!
</p>

<h2> Building an OpenID-enabled TurboGears Application, Step One</h2>
<p>I had already run the <code>tg-admin quickstart</code> command to create a web application
   directory. This creates a directory tree with skeletal Python files and Kid
   templates ready for you to modify; some people will not like this, but the files
   it creates are essentially what you would end up with if you wrote it starting
   from scratch (and were very organized), so I’m happy with it.
</p>
<p>To add a ‘Please Log In’ page, I started by adding a method to <code>controllers.py</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>class Root(controllers.Root):
    ...
    @turbogears.expose(html=’picky2.templates.login’)
    def login(self, next=’./’):
        return dict(next=next)
</code></pre><p>This tells the server that URLs like <code>http://localhost:8080/login?next=foo</code> are
   handled by rendering the template <code>picky2.templates.login</code> (Picky2 is the
   application name), passing the value of the <code>next</code> variable as a parameter to
   the template. This will be used, once the user is logged in, to redirect them
   to the page they started on.
</p>
<p>The template in turn is created by copying <code>welcome.kid</code> and
   editing to look something like this:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "xhtml+kid.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:py="http://purl.org/kid/ns#"
        py:extends="’master.kid’"&gt;    
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="content-type" py:replace="’’"/&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Picky2 Playpen&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;    
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div id="loginForm" class="form"&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Log in!&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;form action="loginBegin" method="get"&gt;
                &lt;input type="hidden" name="next" value="${next}"/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    &lt;label for="urlbox"&gt;Log in with your blog URL:&lt;/label&gt;
                    &lt;input type="text" name="url" size="60" id="urlbox"/&gt;
                    &lt;input type="submit" value="Log me in!"/&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p>This is mostly the usual HTML for displaying a form.  The point to note is
   is that the <code>next</code> parameter is squirrelled away in a hidden form
   item.
</p>
<p>One nice thing about Kid templates is
   they they are well-formed XML; if you have an XML-savvy text editor—such as
   <a href="http://jedit.org/">jEdit</a>—it can check the syntax of templates as you type, and save you from
   generating bad HTML that is only detected when it is in the browser. (In order to
   placate <a href="http://jedit.org/">jEdit</a>’s XML validator, I created my own <code>XHTML+kid.dtd</code>
   document-type definition file; it is supposed to be XHTML with Kid’s attributes
   permitted everywhere, but I have only done as much as is necessary to make my
   templates validate.  Or I could have just removed the <code>!DOCTYPE</code> declaration.)
</p>
<p>Now I can switch to my Firefox window and visit the login page to see it all
   working.
</p>
<p>The <code>action</code> attribute for the <code>form</code> element is <code>loginBegin</code>, so I need to add
   another method to <code>controllers.py</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>import authentication
...

class Root(...):
    ...
    @turbogears.expose(html=’picky2.templates.login’)
    def loginBegin(self, url, next):
        """Called when user clicks OK on the login form."""
        openId = authentication.openId()
        status, inf = openId.beginAuth(url)
        if status == ‘success’:
            returnUri = self.openIdReturnUri(inf, next)
            openIdUri = openId.constructRedirect(inf, returnUri, ‘http://localhost:8080/’)
            raise cherrypy.HTTPRedirect(openIdUri)
        # If we get here, then the OpenID server could not be contacted.
        return dict(error=status, detail=inf, next=next, who=None, openId=None)

    def openIdReturnUri(self, inf, next):
        """Given an OpenID request information object, return a URI on this server."""
        token = uriParamEncode(inf.token)
        next = uriParamEncode(next)
        return ‘http://localhost:8080/loginFinish?token=%s&amp;next=%s’ % (token, next)
</code></pre><p>The argument names for the <code>loginBegin</code> method correspond to the form parameters
   in the HTML. The <code>url</code> parameter is the URI the user wants to use as their
   identifier. The <code>openId</code> object is an instance of <code>OpenIDConsumer</code>
   from a module I will write next
   that wraps up the Python-OpenID library. The <code>beginAuth</code> method visits the URI
   and looks for a link to an OpenID server. If all goes well, it returns the
   information needed to make the complete URI of the remote OpenID server with all
   the right parameters (via the <code>constructRedirect</code> method).  To perform the
   redirection, it seems the standard idiom is to throw an <code>cherrypy.HTTPRedirect</code>
   exception.
</p>
<p>If the <code>OpenIDConsumer</code> object returns anything other than success, this is
   passed to the same Kid template (<code>login.kid</code>) as before.  Thus it shows the same
   form as before, except with an error message added below it.  This requires
   adding something to the template to include the error message:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="error" py:if="error"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
         Could not verify your identity
         because of ${error}&lt;span py:if="detail" py:replace="detail"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre><p>Not elegant, but adequate for my test version. The <code>py:if</code> attribute ensures
   this <code>div</code> element completly vanishes if there is no error code.
</p>
<p>The big gotcha in the above is in the method <code>openIdReturnUri</code>: the token and
   next-URI parameters need to be escaped with <code>uriParamEncode</code> so that they do not
   get scrambled when they get read back in at the end.  My first attempt omitted
   this step, and I got mysterious failures as a result.
</p>

<h2> Creating the OpenIDController Object</h2>
<p>The bit that I have swept under the carpet is the code that actually creates the
   <code>OpenIDConsumer</code> object that does most of the work in my <code>loginBegin</code> method.  I
   put this in its own module out of a sense of tidiness; as it turns out, the
   amount of code is small enough that I might as well have simply included it in
   <code>controllers.py</code>, but never mind.  Here is is:
</p>
<pre><code>from pysqlite2 import dbapi2 as sqlite
from openid.consumer import consumer
from openid.store import sqlstore

def openId():
    """Return an object that may be used to authenticate user using the OpenID protocol."""
    #TODO get database info from configuration file...?
    con = sqlite.connect(’openid.db’)
    store = sqlstore.SQLiteStore(con)
    return consumer.OpenIDConsumer(store)
</code></pre><p>For now the database used is always called <code>openid.db</code>. I could probably have
   simply used the connection settings from TurboGears so as to use the same
   database file used to store everything else in my application, but I like the
   idea of separating the data managed by Python-OpenID from the rest of my data. 
</p>
<p>The main gotcha is that I expected the database connection function to be
   <code>pysqlite2.connect</code> but it is instead <code>pysqlite2.dbapi2.connect</code>, which took me
   a little Googling to find.
</p>
<p>Python allows a module to double as a program by adding an <code>if __name__ ==
‘__main__’</code> clause at the end. I used this to add the code that must be run once
   to initialize the OpenID database:
</p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == ‘__main__’:
    import sys

    if sys.argv[1] == ‘create’:
        print ‘Creating tables for OpenID support...’
        con = sqlite.connect(’openid.db’)
        store = sqlstore.SQLiteStore(con)
        store.createTables()
</code></pre>
<h2> Step Two: Handling the Return from the OpenID Server</h2>
<p>At this point I can enter my LiveJournal URI
   <code>http://damiancugley.livejournal.com/</code> in to the form and press the button and I
   am amagically transported to the LiveJournal page that validates OpenID
   requests:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <div>
        <a href="../../2006/openid-1.png"><img src="../../2006/openid-1-50pc.png" alt="(screenshot)"
        /></a>
    </div>
</blockquote>

<p>Clicking on the Yes button takes me back to my server, which prompty complains
   that I have not defined a <code>loginFinish</code> method yet.  (It gets that name from the
   return URI parameter included in the OpenID request.)  To implement this, we
   just add another method to <code>controllers.py</code> as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>@turbogears.expose(html=’picky2.templates.login’)
def loginFinish(self, token, next, **kws):
    """Called when OpenID server has approved user’s login.

    token – as returned by OpenIDConsumer
    next – as passed to the original login method;
        URI of the page to redirect to once user is authenticated
    """
    # TODO. Check return_to equals expected value
    openId = authentication.openId()
    status, inf = openId.completeAuth(token, kws)
    if status == ‘success’:
        # TODO. Create cookie
        turbogears.flash(’Welcome to Picky2’)
        raise cherrypy.HTTPRedirect(next)
    return dict(error=status, detail=None, next=next, who=inf, openId=kws)
</code></pre><p>There a re a couple of bits that I have not yet put in—thus the <code>TODO</code>
   comments—but this method does the bare minimum: it checks the results using
   <code>OpenIDConsumer.completeAuth</code>, and redirects to the URL that was originally
   passed to the <code>login</code> page and has been passed like a football from page to
   page since.  The <code>turbogears.flash</code> causes an extra message to appear (<del>I’m not
   sure how this works with more than one visitor, unless there is some form of
   session management I am unaware of</del> <ins>using a cookie</ins>).
</p>
<p>So voil&agrave;—a working OpenID consumer in not very many lines of code at
   all.<br/>
</p>

<h2> What Comes Next?</h2>
<p>I have already experimented with uploading pictures; now I need to link up the
   pictures with the person who uploaded them. When I next have some time for
   playing with TurboGears, I will report on how I get on with that.
