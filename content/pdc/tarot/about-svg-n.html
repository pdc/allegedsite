      <h1>A little about SVG</h1>
      <h2>Scalable versus pixmap</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)</a>
        is a new file format for graphics on
        the web.  How does this differ from

<acronym title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</acronym>,

<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG/"><acronym title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</acronym></a>, and

<acronym title="Joint Phorographic Expert Group">JPEG</acronym>?  The short
        answer is that it is an example of a <dfn>vector</dfn> format (also called
        outlines or scalable graphics); the others are examples of

<dfn>raster</dfn> formats (also called bitmap or pixmap).  The difference
        is the manner in which the picture is described.  We can interpret a
        GIF or PNG as instructions for creating a mosaic, along the lines of:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Create a mosaic of 10000 pixels in a grid of 100 rows of
        100 tiles, in order white, white, white, white, white, red, red, ... (etc.)
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        You would not want to describe a picture to a human painter this
        way, but to a computer this is very simple and convenient.  All modern
        computer screens naturally work this way.  Raster graphics is also the
        natural format for images produced by a scanner or digital camera.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vector graphics is more like the way you might decribe a drawing to
        a person:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        On a page 100 by 100 units, draw: a red triangle whose
        corners lie at (10,20), (40,20), and (40,60); a blue circle centred on
        (50,50) with radius 10 ... (etc.)
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Most drawings in practice use fancier shapes than triangles and circles.  Most formats support <dfn>paths</dfn> of any length, composed of straight line segments and curved lines defined using mathematical functions.
        The curves used in SVG are cubic and quadratic B&eacute;ziers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This style of description obviously works best for pictures drawn
        as shapes, as opposed to, for example, scanned photographs (although
        there is software for converting pixmaps to outlines, and vector
        formats can contain embedded raster images).  If you are graphics
        designer you will already have recognized these two classes of image
        as corresponding to Adobe Photoshop (or Painter, the GIMP, etc.) and
        Adobe Illustrator (CorelDRAW, etc.)  respectively.
      </p>
      <h2>SVG features</h2>
      <p>
        One advantage of vector formats is because the drawing instructions
        are explicit, the program doing drawing can exploit the full
        resolution of the output device (screen or printer) it is using.  If
        you have printed out web pages, you will be familiar with how raster
        graphics optimized for display on the screen look fuzzy when printed,
        because printers have more pixels per inch.  You can display vector
        graphics at different sizes and they all look smoothly scaled&mdash;if
        you resize bitmaps too much, the results are again fuzzy and blurred
        (when shrunk), or jagged and blocky (when expanded).  If you use
        Adobe&rsquo;s plug-in, you can zoom in and pan the image as much as
        you like.  I&rsquo;ve used this to hide invisible details in some of
        the pictures!
      </p>
      <p>
        Another benefit is that the items being drawn retain their
        individual identity in the picture file.  This allows for them to be
        moved and resized to make simple animations and to react to mouse
        clicks by doing things.  SVG files can contain Javascript programs
        that arbitrarily rearrange the picture and do everything Javascript
        can do.  They also have built-in animation features that mean you
        don&rsquo;t even need to use Javascript to make things happen.
