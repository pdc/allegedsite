        The Empress is here associated with Demeter or Ceres (goddess
        of fertility and the seasons).  The bounty of nature is
        represented through civilized symbols: the grain and fruit she
        carries and the cow in the background represent cultivation and
        animal husbandry; the rolling hills are the result of agriculture
        rather than erosion.  To a mediaeval person, surrounded by
        dangerous forests and barren mountains, a tilled field is more
        attractive than a natural wilderness: enjoying the scenery is a
        luxury reserved for people who are no longer threatened by it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where the Papess represents female spirituality (which the
        ancients saw as mysterious and scary), the Empress stands for a
        feminine aspect of temporal authority&mdash;and in mediaeval
        times, women were in charge of food, hearth and home&mdash;and not
        much else.
      </p>
      <p>
        In magical tradition, the Empress is also the first authority
        figure in the body&ndash;mind&ndash;spirit ensemble.
      </p>

        It is a little hard to see this in 2D, but my Empress&rsquo;s
        crown has 12 red stones (five of them are on side of her head you
        can&rsquo;t see) and four of those round stones in the pointy bits
        (one of them is hidden).  Together with the Zodiac symbols on her
        dress, these symbolize the annual cycle of the seasons.  Red
        flowers and the red in her dress traditionally represent menstrual
        blood; the waterfall and the blue in her dress are another symbol
        of fertility.
