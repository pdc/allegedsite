        The chariot card shows a chariot drawn by two horses (or
        fabulous beasts if you prefer a more magical look).  The person in
        the chariot is often shown armoured and without reins&mdash;the
        beasts are controlled by the will.  Like the pillars in the
        picture of the Papess, the beasts are coloured black and white to
        represent the mysterious female principle and the transparent male
        principle.  The figure in the chariot represents our sense of self
        or will, which must guide the course of the chariot no matter how
        the much the two horses want to take over and gallop off in random
        directions.  Apparently this illustration of the will versus our
        baser natures goes all the way back to Plato.  It can also be
        interpreted in terms of Freud&rsquo;s model (the superego
        controlling the id and ego, or however it is supposed to work).
      </p>
      <p>
        The helmet my charioteer is wearing is not from any particular
        historical period, although the chariot itself looks reasonably
        Roman or Greek.  For no particular reason I&nbsp;have identified
        the chariot with Apollo&rsquo;s (if the giant sun background is
        anything to go by).  Since Apollo is god of reason
        and self-discipline, perhaps this is appropriate.
