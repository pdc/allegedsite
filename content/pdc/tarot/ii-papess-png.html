        Old Italian tarot decks had a Pope and Papess (female Pope)
        rather than Hierophant and High Priestess, and I&nbsp;have
        followed suit.  To mediaeval Italians, the Pope represented
        religious authority,  and if representing the Pope in a deck
        of cards is cheeky, the Papess is downright subersive&mdash;a
        definite dig at the Establishment.  This is consitent with the
        origin of the Tarot deck as a gambling or gaming deck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays we think of the Pope (Hierophant) as representing an
        advisor, not necessarily on spiritual and religious matters; the
        Papess can be read as standing for going outside regular channels,
        following one&rsquo;s intuition, finding one&rsquo;s own spiritual
        path.  The High Priestess represents the same idea, but within the
        System rather than subverting it.  This is a reflection of the
        idea that mystery and the hidden are an essential part of life,
        rather than an exception to the rule.
      </p>

        In this aspect the card is also known as Juno (the most most
        powerful of the Roman godesses, governing marriage, and identified
        with the Greek goddess Hera).  The connection is with the
        Women&rsquo;s Mysteries of the classical world.

        The Papess sits between two pillars I&nbsp;have labelled Alpha
        and Omega (sometimes Cabalistically called Boaz and Jachin after
        
        <a href="http://www.queenofpentacles.com/articles/boaz_jachin.html">the
        two pillars in front of Solomon&rsquo;s temple in the Bible</a>).
        They are coloured black and white representing female and male
        principles, the same colours used in the
        
        <a href="http://chinesefortunecalendar.com/yinyang.htm">Chinese Yin-Yang
        symbol</a>.  The Alpha and Omega suggest that everything (or all
        personalities) combines these masculine and feminine traits.  Or
        perhaps the Omega is there to allude to a biological analogy
        between the white male pillar and phallus...
