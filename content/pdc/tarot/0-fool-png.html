      <p>
        The Fool represents a lucky chancer&mdash;happy to take things
        as they come, and not afraid to trust to his fate.  The Fool would
        rather smell the roses than worry too much about the wild animals
        that he wanders amongst or the cliff at his feet or the little dog
        who is trying to warn him to pay attention.  But that&rsquo;s OK,
        at least up to a point.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Major Arcana are viewed as a journey from ignorance to
        wisdom, the Fool represents the start of the journey (or of a new
        journey, or a new cycle).  The pack can be interpreted as
        spiritual baggage (or past karma) of which the Fool is not
        consciously aware.
      </p>
      <p>
        The jester&rsquo;s hat stands in for motley (which does not
        show up very will in stick figures!).   The Fool is sometimes drawn
        as a beggar&mdash;both of these occupations are ones where you own
        little and have no responsibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Fool is the only Major Arcana card to survive to the modern
        playing-card deck.
