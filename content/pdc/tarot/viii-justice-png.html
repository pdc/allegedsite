        You may have expected trump card number VIII to be Strength,
        because in the Rider&ndash;Waite these two cards were transposed
        to make the order better suit the zodiac signs attributed to the
        cards by the Golden Dawn.  Their reordering of the trumps is not
        as arbitrary as it might sound at first; the oldest known tarot
        decks used unnumbered cards (the order of the trumps was either
        self-evident or irrelevant), and it is not too much of a stretch
        to claim that when the numbered decks were first printed, slight
        errors were made.  On the other hand, my virtual deck tends
        whimsically to be modelled on the older decks, and so I&nbsp;have
        followed the older numbering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Justice and other abstract concepts have been depicted as women
        since Classical times because in Greek abstract nouns have the
        feminine gender.
      </p>
      <p>
        My depiction of Justice sans blindfold is also a self-conscious
        archaism: the blindfold is a relatively recent addition to the
        traditional props of the personification of Justice.  I&nbsp;stood
        her on a roof-top because I&nbsp;was thinking of the famous statue
        of Justice standing atop the Old Bailey in London.  This also
        allows my version of justice to search out wrong-doers and take a
        long view unobstructed by personal bias.
