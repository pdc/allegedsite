      <h1>How the dealer works</h1>
      <h2>JavaScript (ECMAScript)</h2>
      <p>

<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/"><abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr></a> files can have Javascript programs embedded in them, just
        like <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/"><abbr title="Hypertext Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></a>.
        So my
        <a href="deal.svg"><code>deal.svg</code></a> graphic is linked to a JavaScript file
        <a href="dealer.js"><code>dealer.js</code></a> which defines a bunch of
        variables and functions
        for decoding the script parameters,
        and &quot;dealing&quot; cards.  The outermost <code>svg</code> element in
        the picture has an <code>onload</code> attribute  that invokes
        a  function <code>ol</code> that ties them all together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first thing it does is call
        <code>scanOpts</code>
        which extracts the parameters to the script from the
        <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>. The params recognized at present are
        <code>lo</code>, which must name one of the
        layouts it the &quot;database&quot; of layouts (described later),
        and <code>q</code>, the question text.
        An example <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> defining
        those parameters would be  <code>deal.svg?lo=horseshoe&amp;q=Will+Frodo+reach+Mordor%2F</code>
        (where the
        plus signs represent spaces, and <code>%2F</code> is an encoded question mark).
      </p>
      <p>

Then <code>ol</code> creates an array of 78 numbers representing the cards
        and calls <code>shuffle</code> to rearrange them randomly.
        Finally it calls <code>dealLayout</code> to
        generate images of cards &quot;drawn&quot; from the deck
        at positions on the screen defined by the layout.
      </p>
      <h2>Dealing cards with <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr></h2>
      <p>
        <img src="coins-3-100w.png" align="right" width="100" height="137" />

Each card is represented by a bunch of SVG elements&mdash;the
        rectangle that is the backdrop, the image of the card, the text, etc.
        Rather than try to write JavaScript code that creates all these
        elements, I created a template in the <code>defs</code> section which
        is cloned once for each dealt card.  This uses the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> functions
        <code>getElementById</code> to locate the items that need to be modified
        (such as the link, whose <code>xlink:href</code> attribute must be modified),
        and finally <code>cloneNode</code> to make a copy that can
        be appended to the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="cups-8-64x64.png" align="left" width="64" height="64" />

The advantage of using <code>getElementById</code> each time
        is that it avoids having the code that makes the per-card changes
        having to know the details of how the cards are drawn.
        I should be able to make changes to the <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> template
        without breaking the dealing part.
      </p>
      <h2>Storing layouts as XML</h2>
      <p>

A layout is an arrangement of dealt cards, eahc of which needs to have
        an indication of its role in the spread
        (this card represents the seeker, that one the future, and so on).
        At first I stored this in the JavaScript as a dictionary
        (=object) mapping layout names to a sequence of card coordinates:
      </p>
      <pre>
var layoutDefs = {
    three: [0,0,'past', 1,0,'present', 2,0,'future'],
    ...etc...
};</pre>
      <p>
        This worked well enough, but when it came to the Celtic Cross
        spread&mdash;which has one card laid crosswise&mdash;I realized
        this was too limited for the long term.  So I rewrote the

<code>dealLayout</code> function to instead use <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/"><abbr title="Extensible Mark-up Language">XML</abbr></a> data stored in the
        <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> document itself:
      </p>
      <pre>
&lt;lo:layouts xmlns:lo="http://www.alleged.org.uk/pdc/tarot/"&gt;
    &lt;lo:layout id="three"&gt;
        &lt;lo:card col="0" row="0" title="past"&gt;&lt;/lo:card&gt;
        &lt;lo:card col="1" row="0" title="present"&gt;&lt;/lo:card&gt;
        &lt;lo:card col="2" row="0" title="future"&gt;&lt;/lo:card&gt;
    &lt;/lo:layout&gt;
    ....
&lt;/lo:layouts&gt;</pre>
      <p>
        This goes in the <code>defs</code> section, along with the
        template for the cards.  (I cannot find a reference
        in the <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> specification that makes it explicit that
        embedding random <abbr title="Extensible Mark-up Language">XML</abbr> data in <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> is kosher, but it seems
        to be implied by wording on the <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> section of the W3C site.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The JavaScript code uses the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> conventions to read the
        information needed to lay out the cards.  Using <abbr title="Extensible Mark-up Language">XML</abbr> means that it
        was easy to add another attribute indicating a rotated card&mdash;and
        makes it easy to extend the format when adding new exotic layouts in
        future. For example, longer descriptions of the significance of each
        of the positions in the spread?
      </p>
      <h2>Converting questions to numbers</h2>
      <p>

The querent&rsquo;s question affects the deal through the

&quot;shuffling&quot; process.  The shuffling is controlled by a sequence of
        78 pseudo-random numbers, and the pseudo-random number sequence in
        turn depends on a <dfn>seed</dfn> number.  The function

<code>questionToSeed</code> converts the character string in to a single
        number.  The algorithm used is a simple one I found after a little
        time with Google.  (Try
        <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=g_str_hash+X31_HASH">g_str_hash X31_HASH</a>).
