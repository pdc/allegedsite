        In some decks this is card VIII&mdash;a modification designed
        to make the tarot deck better match the order of the signs of the
        zodiac (since Leo preceeds Libra in the zodiac).  If you see the
        trumps as a progression through life, then it is nice that
        strength of mind preceeds the application of justice.  Of course
        the oldest known tarot decks use unnumbered cards; for their owners
        the order of the trumps was either self-evident or irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having reverted to an older ordering, I&nbsp;did not use the
        older name, Fortitude, even though this might better suggest the
        significance of the card, which relates to strength of will or
        moral strength, rather than physical strength.  The woman holding
        the jaws of a lion is the traditional personification of
        Fortitude (one of Plato&rsquo;s cardinal virtues); the lion is her
        traditional prop just as the scales are Justice&rsquo;s and wings
        and two jars are of Temperance.  (The fourth cardinal virtue,
        Prudence, is not represented in the tarot deck.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The lion can be seen as representing powerful emotional or
        physical feelings that one must direct to creative ends; both
        complete suppression and a free rein  lead to bad outcomes.
