Title: The ‘cite’ that is Understood is not the True ‘cite’

[Mark Pilgrim reports][0] that he’s been misusing the HTML `cite` element all these years because the [HTML 5 definition][5] contradicts his use of `cite` to wrap authors’ names. Just when I was about to crow excitedly that I’d always said he was wrong, I checked the old specs and discovered we both were—or actually, that HTML 4 was wrong. 

For what it’s worth, the element `cite` originally its name and meaning from the `@cite`
request [in Texinfo][1], which refers simply to book titles. The HTML 2 spec also [mentions
book titles only][2]. Both mention that titles are usually shown italicized.

The [HTML 4.01 definition][3] is ‘contains a citation or a reference to other sources’
which would be vaguely consistent with HTML 2, *except* the examples show it used to
surround the name of a speaker and a coded reference, and not book titles. Obviously the
authors of the HTML 4 recommendation were guided not by existing definition and the usage
in existing documents, but by the name of the element. To my mind this constitutes poor
scholarship, the same sloppiness that has caused the `dfn` and `var` elements to lose their
original meanings.

The result of this is that HTML 4 *changed the meaning* of one of the OH SO IMPORTANT
semantic elements of HTML, which in turn does rather indicate that the semantic content was
perhaps NOT SO IMPORTANT AS ALL THAT, given that no-one working on HTML 4 knew what the
meaning of the cite element was!

And before you accuse me of being some proponent of wysiwyg point-and-drool word-processing, check out the articles on this very web site. There are documents going back over ten years, and for the first five I consistently used `cite` for book titles, which was correct according to HTML 2, but incorrect according to HTML 4. Since I switched to using [Markdown][4] to write my articles in, I have lost the facility to easily distinguish italicized book titles from italicized anything else, but after years of careful, pedantic mark-up with no reward I find I don’t care any more.
