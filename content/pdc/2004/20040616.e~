I want to work on the [Caption 2004 web site][1] but not trapped at my
desk upstairs.  So I want to copy my working files to my PowerBook,
preferably with [`rsync`][2] (since it is about time I got that
working).  Turns out my creaking Linux box does not have `rsync`.
Downloaded and installed it.  

Refreshed my memory of SourceForge so that I could use CVS to check
out a copy of [TclHTML][3], used to generate the HTML files.  The
SourceForge documentation still claims their CVS server is
`cvs.sf.net`, but it turns out that nowadays it is
`cvs.tclhtml.sf.net`.  Luckily I remembered my password!

Doing `make` on TclHTML reveals a dependency on `giftopnm`, part of
[Netpbm][4], a package of graphical utilities built on [Jef
Poskanzer][5]'s pbmplus.  Downloaded this and its configure script
demands [`libjpeg`][6].  But that's OK, IJG follow the GNU
conventions.  Wait, it needs [`libtool`][7].  So I installed that with
[FinkCommander][8].  Come to think of it, I could have installed
`libjpeg` with Fink.  Doing that will make it easier to upgrade later,
so what the heck, I deleted the copy I'd downloaded and got Fink to
repeat it.  Next [`libtiff`][9], and [`libpng`][10], also via Fink.
Anyways, in the end I got NetPBM installed, at which point I was able
to make a working copy of the web site I can edit downstairs (where it
is cooler) so long as I don't need to consult anything on the web.

Another task for the day was upgrading my Internet connection from
dial-up to one of NTL's cable-based broadband systems.  First I tried
using the [NTL web site][11].  There is a snag: they have a package
that is £29 for (a)&nbsp;all the non-premium channels plus
(b)&nbsp;telephone line rental, but when you go to buy a package, the
cable package now costs £19·50 and does not include phone.
This would not be a problem if their list of phone deals included the
implied £9·50/mo plain old phone option, but they only list
the extra-cost free-weekend-minutes services.  (Looks like NTL have
been infected with the same mindworm that infests people who market
mobile phones.)

In the end I abandoned the on-line application and called them.  After
an impressively deep tree of phone menus I was offered the expected
£29 deal as expected, except their (new) computer system was
overloaded, my sales assistant (if that is the correct term) was at
the end of her shift, and, well, they will phone tomorrow to confirm a
date for the engineer to call.

Interestingly, NTL have web servers at `www.ntl.co.uk`, `www.ntl.com`,
`www.ntlhome.com`, and so on, but not `ntl.co.uk`...
