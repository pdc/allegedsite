MUTT: Treeification
-------------------

The MUTT transform turns an almost-tree-like MU document in to one with
no overlapping ranges, suitable to expressing as a an HTML-style DOM.
The detailed algorithm is outlined on the [LMNL site][7] but the gist is
that when you meet an end-tag, you insert (or imply) end-tags for the
unmatched start-tags, and remember them so they can be reinserted after
the end tag (or after a sequence of consecutive end-tags).

For example, when scanning `<b><i>bi</b>it</i>`, we insert `</i>` before
the `</b>`, and remember that we have to insert a fresh `<i>` tag after
it, giving `<b><i>bi</i></b><i>it</i>`.
