Spent this Saturday in London to see the [Tamara de Lempicka][1]
exhibition [at the <abbr title="Royal Academy of Arts">RA</a>][2].  As
usual the main challenge was finding the RA, and after that finding
the right entrance (the one we found first was for football fans
only).

The exhibition was perfectly formed but small so we still had time to
rush accross town to the
<abbr title="Victoria and Albert Museum">V&A</abbr> to see
[the other flower show][5] and [their retrospective][3] of [Vivienne
Westwood][4], which is great.  We were rushed out at the end and had
only the briefest glance through the inevitable tat shop.  Jeremy
feels extra pleased with her (second-hand) Westwood tee-shirt now
she's seen them on sale for £65 new...

Outside the V&A a crowd was gathering.  Eventually we worked out it
was there to see the Olympic torch procession.

We dutifully accepted a blue inflatable baguette from Samsung and a
London pennant from Coca-Cola.  Some kids has flags of various
nations, but we were too late to claim any of those.  The running man
ran past too fast for me to take a decent photo.  Jeremy got a better
snap of him.

Aftwerwards we decided to walk to the [Linus][6] gig at Needles
through Hyde Park rather than trying to use the Tube (guessing that it
would be crowded with the crowds that had gathered to watch the
procession).  On the way we passed [the Albert Memorial][7], which is quite
a bit of work!

This is just a sample of one of the corners, which shows a Victorian
conception of the Americas, complete with man in cowboy hat, with
moustache, musket, and Greek drapery!

As we walked through the extensive rose gardens of Hyde Park, the Red
Arrows flew overhead, spouting red, white, and blue smoke.
