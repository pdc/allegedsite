</p>

<h2> The importance of metadata</h2>
<p>A MU instance cannot stand entirely alone – no text file can, because
   you need to know the encoding used to convert the character data to a
   the sequence of bytes actually stored on disc or transmitted over the
   network.  (As discussed in the previous entry, the MU data does not
   describe its own encoding.)
</p>
<p>I will describe two ways to store metadata for MU documents, one using
   MIME media-type parameters and the other as a separate resource in a
   format called MUD.  A MUD-savvy web servers will use the metadata in
   the MUD to construct the <code>Content-type</code> headers.<br/>
</p>

<h2> MIME-type parameters</h2>
<p>In the fantasy world in which MU exists, the Internet media-type for
   MU is <code>text/mu</code>, with variations like <code>text/html+mu</code>
   permitted in a manner similar to the <code>+xml</code> convention.
</p>
<p>There is some discussion as to where XML data should be
   <code>application/xml</code> or <code>text/xml</code>.  I am pretty sure that the reasons
   for preferring the former is that (a) not all XML data is supposed to
   be a document for reading by human beings, and (b) media-types
   starting with <code>text/</code> are subject to transcoding, and that would break
   XML documents that mention their own encoding.  MU is not intended as
   a general-purpose serialization format, and can be transcoded (because
   the program doing the transcoding will emend the metadata), so I think
   that makes <code>text/mu</code> OK.  I might be wrong, though.
</p>
<p>The <code>charset</code> parameter specifies how to convert the bytes in to
   characters.  Thus one can have things like
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
      <code>text/mu; charset=ISO8859-1</code> 
 </li>

 <li>
      <code>text/mu; charset=UTF-8</code> 
 </li>

 <li>
      <code>text/mu; charset=UTF-16LE</code> 
 </li>
</ul>
<p>And for compatibility with other RFCs I am too lazy to look up,
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     an omitted <code>charset</code> means the MU document is in strict US-ASCII; 
 </li>

 <li>
     if the charset is UTF-16, then the data may be (a) a byte-order
     mark 0xFF 0xFE followed by UTF-16LE data, (b) a BOM
     0xFE 0xFF followed by UTF-16BE data, or (c) UTF-16BE data with no BOM.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>The first point diverges from HTML, which vaguely assumes ISO 8859-1
   in the absence of a charset but then requires increasingly
   hair-raising guesses depending on the byte values the parser
   encounters.  But MU documents must always be accompanied by a valid
   media-type, and that MUST include a <code>charset</code> if the encoding is not
   US-ASCII.
</p>
<p>Another parameter is <code>mud</code>.  This gives one or more URIs for MUD
   resources to be used when interpreting this MU resource.  This is a
   list of one or more URIs separated by whitespace.  For example,
</p>
<pre>
text/mu; charset=UTF-8; mud="http://example.org/muds/formz.mud"
</pre>

<p>Note that MUDs for popular formats will of course be cached, so the
   standard URI should be used wherever possible.
</p>

<h2> MUD units</h2>
<p>In this document I am not describing MUD features in complete
   detail as would be required by a real spec.
   The underlying format of the MUD unit is <a href="http://yaml.org" title="Yaml Ain’t Mark-up Language">YAML</a>.  A formal
   specification of MUD, if such a thing extsited, might define a syntax
   that is a subset or profile of the full YAML syntax.  For example:
</p>
<pre>
media type: text/html+mu
charset: UTF-8
features:
  - tag:alleged.org,2004:mu:link/1.0
  - tag:alleged.org,2004:mu:object/1.0
namespaces:
  html: http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml
  dc: http://purl.org/dc/1.0
</pre>

<p>The <code>media type</code> property is MIME type and subtype, sans parameters.  
   The key <code>charset</code> gives the character encoding of the MU.  A MUD-savvy web
   server would use these to generate a complete MIME media-type for the
   MU resource, with a <code>mud</code> parameter pointing at the MUD unit.  Note
   that the media type from the web server takes precedence over any
   <code>media type</code> and <code>charset</code> parameters in the MUD (to allow for
   transcoding).
</p>
<p>The connection of MU to MUD for files on a computer’s file system will
   depend partly on the underlying operating system.  On a Macintosh with
   HFS, the MUD unit might conceivably be a <code>MUD!</code> resource of the MU
   document.  Ditto for other operating systems which allow multipart
   files natively – although if I were to point out that this includes
   NTFS it would probably suprise a lot of Windows NT developers!
</p>
<p>Otherwise processors could automatically expect that a document
   <code>foo/bar.mu</code> will have a MUD resource available as <code>foo/bar.mud</code>, or,
   failing that, <code>foo/DEFAULT.mud</code>.
</p>

<h2> MUD imports</h2>
<p>The key <code>imports</code> has as its value a list if URIs, each on a separate
   line, introduced with a hyphen-space (YAML list syntax).  For example:
</p>
<pre>
imports:
  - http://www.example.org/2004/html.mud
  - http://www.example.org/2004/formz.mud
  - http://www.example.org/2004/mathml.mud
</pre>

<p>Imports means reading in the extra MUD files and merging their
   properties.<br/>
</p>
<p>The key <code>base</code> can be used to specify the base for partial URIs (same
   idea as <code>xml:base</code>).
</p>
<p>The use of imports allows for a MUD embedded in a file (as a Macintosh
   resource, say) to be very short, limited to a <code>charset</code> and an
   <code>imports</code> parameter).
</p>

<h2> Namespaces</h2>
<p>The purpose of namespaces is to allow sets of tags defined by
   different organizations to be mixed without prior arrangement.
   Namespaces are not intended to be used to indicate the
   <em>interpretation</em> of the tags; for that, see the <code>features</code> property
   described below.
</p>
<p>The <code>namespaces</code> parameter is a mapping from prefixes to URIs.  In the
   MUD this is represented as namespace-colon-URI pairs, one per line,
   indented (the YAML syntax for maps).  For example:
</p>
<pre>
namespaces:
  html: http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml
  form: tag:example.org,2004:formz
</pre>

<p>Each of these maps a namespace prefix to the subject indicator for its
   namespace.  No implication is made that there is a downloadable
   resource at this URI; they are used merely to supply a globally unique
   identifier.<br/>
</p>
<p>There is no default namespace.  Tags with no prefix are promiscuous so
   far as special meanings (specified by features, below) are concerned.
</p>
<p>MU namespaces are simpler than XML namespaces in a couple of ways:
   they are specified outside the MU document (not on individual
   elements), and so apply uniformly throughout the document.  A MU
   editor that is assembling a document from arbitrary fragments can
   collect together their namespaces and if necessary munge the prefixes
   to make them unique.
</p>
<p>Mixed-namespace documents should not be needed as much with MU as with
   XML, because MU does not need to use namespaces to trigger special
   features.  For example, MU can use <code>href</code> for links (using the
   <code>features</code> property described below), rather than having to have
   <code>xlink:href</code> or <code>xml:href</code> as separately namespaced  attributes.
</p>
<p>Also, inclusion of data in different formats is expected to be done
   through links rather than in-line.
</p>

<h2> Features</h2>
<p>The key <code>features</code> introduces a list of URIs that are subject
   indicators for features required in the MU processor to correctly
   render this document.<br/>
</p>
<p>The term <code>subject indicator</code> means a URI that does not refer to actual
   downloadable resources, but is used as a token for a software feature
   the processor must support to make sense of this document.  The URIs
   may well be compiled in to the plug-in implementing the feature.
</p>
<p>For example, we might define the URI
   <code>tag:alleged.org.uk,2004:mu:link/1.0</code> to mean that <code>href</code> and <code>src</code>
   attributes have the same meanings as <code>xml:href</code> and <code>xml:src</code> in
   <a href="http://dubinko.info/writing/skunklink/">Skunklink</a>.<br/>
</p>
<p>Features will generally be associated with a namespace, but that does
   not mean that the tags that are recognized by a feature must always
   have a namespace prefix: tags are offered to all
   feature implementations and features should match tags (a) with their
   namespace prefix, and (b) with no prefix. 
</p>
<p>For example, we might define a <code>switch</code> tag in a namespace
   <code>tag:alleged.org,2004:mu:switch</code> and include the  URI
   <code>tag:alleged.org,2004:mu:switch/1.0</code> amongst the features.
   This allows us to have a MU fragment like the following:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;p>
    This is HTML with an image:
    &lt;switch>
        &lt;img feature="tag:alleged.org,2004:mu:svg/1.0" 
              src="../../2004/foo.svg"/>
        &lt;img feature="tag:alleged.org,2004:mu:png/1.0" 
          implementation="msie/5.5" src="../../2004/foo-noalpha.png"/>
        &lt;img feature="tag:alleged.org,2004:mu:png/1.0" 
              src="../../2004/foo.png"/>
        &lt;span>FOO&lt;/span>
    &lt;/switch>
    And on with the text.
&lt;/p>
</pre>

<p>The <code>p</code>, <code>span</code> and <code>img</code> tags are recognized by the HTML feature,
   say, so implicitly in the <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code> namespace,
   whereas the <code>switch</code> tag, and <code>feature</code> and <code>implementation</code>
   attributes are recognized by the switch feature and are implicitly in
   its namespace.<br/>
</p>
<p>The idea here is to allow modularization of HTML but to only require
   namespace prefixes when there is ambiguity.  This reduces the load on
   the MU author, which is just as well because we have seen that most
   HTML developers are terrified of XML namespaces!
</p>
<p>If a tag is not recognized by any feature, then the default behaviour
   is to strip the tags and display its content.  This includes the case
   where a feature is not supported by the application.<br/>
</p>
<p>Finally, one of the feature URIs would be (say) <code>tag:alleged.org,2004:css/3</code>,
   and would mean that CSS 3 is used to describe how tags are displayed
   (in the absence of other applicable features).  I imagine that much of
   the HTML compatibility could be expressed in CSS 3.
</p>

<h2> Title</h2>
<p>Does this belong in the MUD or the MU?  I think the MUD but this
   implies that every document needs a separate MUD resource.
</p>

<h2> Links</h2>
<p>Links to other resources.  Each link is itself a mapping:
</p>
<pre>
links:
  - rel: stylesheet
    type: text/css
    href: foo.css
  - rel: alternate
    type: application/atom+xml
    href: bar.atom
</pre>

<p>I think I have gone on about my hypothetical MUD for long enough now.
