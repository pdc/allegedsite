<div></div><p class="first">Discussions of Apple’s proposed extensions to HTML made me wonder if
   perhaps XML is suffering from being too complex and too strict, and
   that a different generalization of HTML might make sense. Here’s my
   completely half-baked ideas, a language I shall call MU. 
</p>

<h2> Incomplete notes on MU</h2>
<p>In fact there are two (meta)languages, MU and MUD. 
   MU is used to <em>mark up</em> documents.  MUD is metadata about the marked-up text (specifically, MUD files can specify the encoding, character-entities beyond the usual <code>&amp;lt;</code> etc., and a few other things).  I’ll outline its format <a href="../../2004/19.html" title="Clear as MUD">later</a>.
</p>

<h2> Encoding</h2>
<p>XML documents start with a declaration that specifies the character
   encoding. In my view this is a problem, because it means that if you
   want to transcode a document, you need a program that can parse the XML
   declaration and alter the character data so it names the new encoding.
   Things get more complicated with HTML because there are various ways
   in which metadata about the encoding is embedded within the document.
</p>
<p>Itwould be easier to require that XML data be accompanied by metadata
   specifying its character encoding, making this an operating-system
   problem, not part of the parser.
</p>
<p>So far as the MU processor is concerned, a MU document is a squence of
   characters, where characters are understood to be <a href="http://www.unicode.org/faq/unicode_iso.html" title="Unicode and ISO 10646 (unicode.org)">Unicode or
ISO-10646</a> code points. Character data should be in Unicode
   Normalization form C, but parsers are not required to enforce this.
</p>
<p>When retrieving a document froma file system or over the net,
   documents are represented as sequences of bytes in the usual way, and
   the recipient must use (1) supplied metadata, if any, (2) sniffing for
   UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32 bytes &agrave; la XML, or (3) the conventions
   of the OS, to determine the encoding. Supplied metadata means things
   like a <code>charset</code> attribute in the MIME content-type, or a supplied MUD
   resource.  MU documents <em>do not</em> refer to their own encoding
   internally.
</p>

<h2> Entity references</h2>
<p>MU uses <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&amp;</code> as its magic characters, not because I think they
   are a good choice but because HTML does. If I were inventing the
   format from scratch, I would be thinking in terms of <code>{</code> and <code>\\</code>
   because they are less prevalent in real text.
</p>
<p>Anhyow, MU and allows character-entity references <code>&amp;amp;</code>, <code>&amp;lt;</code>, <code>&amp;gt;</code>,
   <code>&amp;quot;</code>, and numeric entities <code>&amp;#x...;</code> and <code>&amp;#...;</code>. All of these
   represent single characters; it lacks the SGML or XML concept of 
   entities containing chunks of text. 
</p>
<p>Additional character entities may be
   defined in a MUD file.
</p>

<h2> Tags and ranges</h2>
<p>Tags look like this (please excuse my pseudo-DTD notation):
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     start-tag: <code>&lt;</code> etype ( <code>#</code> match-id )? att* <code>&gt;</code> 
 </li>

 <li>
     end-tag: <code>&lt;</code> <code>/</code> etype  ( <code>#</code> match-id )? <code>&gt;</code> 
 </li>

 <li>
     empty-tag: <code>&lt;</code> etype att* <code>/</code> <code>&gt;</code> 
 </li>

 <li>
     no-range-tag: <code>&lt;</code> etype att* <code>&gt;</code> 
 </li>
</ul>
<p>The rules for tag-matching is that a start-tag must have a matching
   end-tag later in the document. Tags define <em>ranges</em>, not elements, and
   <em>ranges may overlap.</em> 
</p>
<p>There are two reasons to allow overlapping ranges. First, it allows
   people to write things like
   <code>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;bi&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code>, which makes the format more forgiving of
   amateurs. Second, it allows a given text to be marked up according to
   different structures simultaneously. For example, consider
   <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/05/26/totag.html" title="To Tag or Not to Tag: The New Variorum Shakespeare and XML (xml.com)">the XML.com article on tagging Shakespeare</a>. In this there are three
   simultaneous structures: the division of the text in to lines (based on
   the original First Folio edition); the division of the play in to acts,
   scenes, and speeches; and the division of the book in to pages. Add to
   this the requirement that notes refer to words or phrases from the text
   (perhaps overlapping) and the requirement for overlapping mark-up
   becomes apparent. The XML example fudges this by marking up not lines
   but the breaks between them.<br/>
</p>
<p>That said, for many applications a tree-based view of the document
   structure is attractive; this is dealt with by the treeification
   algorithm, described later.
</p>
<p>The purpose of the optional <code>#</code>match-id part is to permit overlapping
   ranges with the same etype, as in <code>&lt;lem#a&gt;foo &lt;lem#b&gt;bar&lt;/lem#a&gt;
baz&lt;/lem#b&gt;</code>. This is a direct steal from <a href="http://www.lmnl.net/" title="The Layered Mark-up and aNnotation Language">LMNL</a>. The matching
   end-tag is  the first unmatched end-tag with the same match-id as the
   start-tag, or with no match-id if the start-tag has no match-id. The
   match-ids are only used by the parser; they are not passed up to the
   client application.
</p>
<p>An empty-tag is equivalent to a start-tag immediately followed by a
   matching
   end-tag.
</p>
<p>There may be a MUD file and it may define a set of <em>no-range</em> etypes, in
   which no-range tags may be used with the same meaning as empty-tags
   (otherwise they would resemble start-tags). For example, if <code>img</code> is
   a no-range element, <code>&lt;img src=\"foo.png"&gt;</code> is equivalent to <code>&lt;img src=\"foo.png"/&gt;</code>.
   Document authors should omit end-tags for no-range elements, and parsers
   should ignore them.
</p>

<h2> Attributes values can omit quotes</h2>
<p>Attributes look like the following:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     att: html-token-att | key-value-att
 </li>

 <li>
     html-token-att: id
 </li>

 <li>
     key-value-att: att-id <code>=</code> ( quoted | apostrophed | naked )
 </li>

 <li>
     quoted: <code>"</code> not-quote* <code>"</code> 
 </li>

 <li>
     apostrophed: <code>‘</code> not-apostrophe* <code>‘</code> 
 </li>

 <li>
     naked: not-space-or-gt* 
 </li>
</ul>
<p>Naked attribute values allows <code>&lt;img src=foo.gif&gt;</code> as a shorthand for
   <code>&lt;img &amp;#x0073;rc="foo.gif"/&gt;</code>. (HTML in theory constrains naked
   values to name tokens, but people often include slashes in them.)  For
   identifiers and numbers, the quotes around attribute values serve no
   real purpose.
</p>
<p>The production html-token-att means those so-called boolean HTML
   attributes like <code>&lt;option selected&gt;</code> that are taken to mean <code>&lt;option
selected="selected"&gt;</code>. I don’t like them; they’re an SGML feature that
   just makes things more complicated, but HTML uses them so in they go.
</p>

<h2> And what is the point of all this?</h2>
<p>The idea is that many HTML documents are already MU documents without
   extra effort – even a fair chunk of the invalid HTML documents that
   exist.  At the same time MU is not an unreasonable format, from the
   point of view of parsers and processors.  The plan is that a lot of
   the second-guessing that pragmatic HTML browsers resort to can be
   rationalized and made legitimate, thus defusing one of the big
   theoretical vs. practical arguments that seems to rage forever these
   days.
