<div></div><p class="first">A lot of people use XML to serialize data structures; with the XML
   parsers bundled with many programming environments it is easier than
   writing one’s own parser. But XML was not designed with this in mind and
   contains too many traps causzed by the mismatch between the XML object
   model and that of your application. A text format designed expressly for
   for the purpose (my favourite is <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a>) would be more convenient
   and safer.
</p>
<p>The application I am developing at work uses a lot of metadata stored as
   XML; some as <a href="http://topicmaps.org/">topic maps</a>, some as plain XML. In dot-Net, using XML
   for configuration files is the path of least resistance. I use a text
   editor, <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a>, that checks the XML files against their DTDs and
   so makes writing valid files easier. But I still spent an afternoon
   trying to work out why adding a single element to my file caused it to
   no longer validate.
</p>
<pre>
... several hundred lines omitted ...
&lt;mumble>
    &lt;foo>Westminster&lt;/foo>
    &lt;bar>
        &lt;baz>&lt;foo>Whitehall&lt;/foo>&lt;goo>Wellington&lt;/goo>&lt;/baz>
    &lt;/bar>.
    &lt;quux>
        &lt;wibble>&lt;wobble/>&lt;/wibble>
    &lt;/quux>
&lt;/mumble>
... several hundred lines omitted ...
</pre>

<p>The error message was something insane like <code>Content of mumble must match
((foo|foofoo)?,(((bar|barbar)?,(bim|bam|bo)?,quux?)|quux+))</code>. I can’t imagine what a normal person would make of this.
   Fortunately I wrote the DTD, so I had some idea of what that hideous expression was meant to mean. I spent
   what seemed like an eternity trying to figure out in what way my XML did
   not match that schema. Maybe my readers will spot my blunder immediately.
</p>
<p>Let’s try the same thing again, assuming a plausible YAML format:
</p>
<pre>
mumbles:
    ...
  - foo: Westminster
    bar:
        baz:
        foo: Whitehall
        goo: Wellington
    .
    quux:
        wibble: wobble
    ...
</pre>

<p>Here the more lightweight syntax means that the extraneous full stop is
   a little easier to spot. YAML would report this as a syntax error. 
</p>
<p>This is an unrealistic error for YAML, of course, because 
   without all those <code>&lt;</code>, <code>/</code>, and <code>&gt;</code> keystrokes flying about
   I would be less likely to accidentally type an extra stop.
   In YAML – at least, with pyYAML – the equivalent invisible error
   would be an extra space after the colon ending a line;
   but then the error message is ‘extra space after colon at end of line
   57’, which makes it easier to work out what is wrong!
</p>
<p>So why can’t the error message I got when validating the XML be
   something as clear as ‘unexpected <code>.</code> at line 99’? The reason is that
   the extra character does not prevent the file from being well-formed;
   character data is allowed between elements, which makes perfect sense
   for marking up text, but is not what you want for serializing a data
   structure. By allowing character data between elements, this error
   cannot be caught until the (optional) schema-checking step, and this results in
   very abstract and difficult-to-interpret error messages.
</p>
<p>Remember that at bottom XML is a mark-up notation. The fragment above is
   conceptually equivalent to the text 
</p>
<embed src="../../2004/westminster.svg" type="image/svg+xml"
        width="360" height="128" />

<p>with the different words underlined in different colours and squiggles (corresponding to elements).
   Viewed this way, my configuration data is obviously <em>not</em> a document, and using XML
   for configuration files is obviously a silly hack.
