<div></div><p class="first">I recently stumbled across <a href="http://taguri.org/">the <code>tag</code> URI scheme</a>, a convention
   that does a lot of what <code>urn</code> and <code>http</code>-based identifiers do with
   less ambiguity and confusion.  But perhaps I had better explain what I
   mean by URI first.
</p>
<p>Background: There are lots of places in the on-line world where it is
   helpful to have a tag for something that is guaranteed not to
   accidentally conflict with a name chosen by someone else.  For
   example, XML namespace identifiers need to be unique.  There are
   various ways to do this; UUIDs (also called GUIDs) and Netnews
   message-ids are examples of standard schemes.
</p>
<p>One way popular at the W3C is to use a URL that you ‘own’ as your
   unique identifier.  Other people will not accidentally choose the same
   name because if they use a URL it will contain their domain name, not
   yours.  For example, <code>http</code> URLs are used to specify XML namespaces
   (XHTML has the namespace <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>, for example),
   and URIs are used in the <a href="http://www.topicmaps.org/">topic map</a> core as subject indicators
   (such as <code>http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/core.xtm#class-instance</code>).
</p>
<p>XML processors do not have to do anything with the namespace URI
   except check whether it is the same as some other namespace URI –
   they do not download it.  Nevertheless there has been continual
   speculation as to what sort of resource <em>should</em> be retrievable from
   that address.
</p>
<p>For this reason, some people prefer to use <strong>URN</strong>s.  URNs are uniform
   resource <em>names</em>, meaning they say what something is without helping
   you to find it – as as opposed to uniform resource <em>locators</em>, which
   say how to download some resource on the WWW, while remaining vague
   about exactly what it is.  URNs look just like URLs, except that
   rather than srtarting with <code>http</code> or <code>ftp</code> they all start with <code>urn</code>.
</p>
<p>At various points in WWW history, URNs have been considered a type of
   URL (because they use the same syntax as URLs), or as distinct from a
   URL (because they do not actually give the location of a resource).
   To having to decide one way or another, WWW recommendations use the
   term URI (uniform resource <em>identifier</em>) to refer collectively to URLs
   and URNs.  To further muddy the waters, there are plenty of
   non-resolvable URL schemas (you cannot actually download
   <code>isbn:1-86197-612-7</code>), and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2168.txt">RFC 2168</a> discusses how to resolve
   URNs!
</p>
<p>One problem with URNs is that although the URN concept and <code>urn</code>
   prefix have been around since the start of the WWW, a formal <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt">syntax
for URNs</a> and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2611.txt">systematic management of the URN namespaces</a> are
   relatively recent and fairly obscure.  Before then, people assumed
   that any string likely to be unique with <code>urn</code> and a colon added to
   the start would do.  As a result, there are plenty of bogus URNs out
   there.
</p>
<p>Another tricky thing is that if <em>I</em> wanted to mint some URNs to use as
   XML namespaces or whatever, I would have to apply to the IANA for a
   URN namespace (documenting how the identifiers in that namespace are
   checked for uniqueness, and so on), attend IETF meetings, etc., all of
   which is a lot of bother.  So URNs do not make sense for everyday
   purposes, only for applications with global scope and big travel
   budgets.
</p>
<p>The <code>tag</code> scheme, by contrast, is refreshingly simple and unencumbered
   by bureaucracy.  Anyone with a domain name or even just an email
   address can mint their own URIs without going via any centralized
   checking.  For example, if I want to propose a published subject
   indicator for W3C date-time formats, I can use
   <code>tag:alleged.org.uk,2004:datetime:w3c</code> without needing special
   permission.
</p>
<p>So what’s the advantage, if any, over using an <code>http</code> URI like
   <a href="http://www.alleged.org.uk/2002/datetime.html#w3c">http://www.alleged.org.uk/2002/datetime.html#w3c</a>?  One difference is
   that the <code>http</code> version commits me to maintaining <a href="../../2004/../../2002/datetime.html" title="Date-Time PSIs">an HTML page</a>
   indefinitely; if for some reason I changed my mind, or the domain
   lapsed or whatever, the URI would remain as a dangling pointer to a
   resource that no longer existed.  It also means that I cannot easily
   publish the description in a different format (such as <a href="http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/">XTM</a> or
   RDF).
</p>
<p>The <code>tag</code> URI makes no promises of resources, which is actually an
   advantage because it can’t break promises it doesn’t make.  You might
   worry about how one finds information about what a <code>tag</code> URI means,
   but don’t.  First, it <em>has</em> no meaning without surrounding context,
   which should furnish clues, and second, <em>there’ll always be Google.</em> 
</p>
<p> <strong>Update</strong> 2004-05-29.  Mark Pilgrim has <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives.2004.05/28/howto-atom-id">an article on Atom ids</a>
   describing <code>tag</code> URIs.
</p>
<p> <strong>Update</strong> 2006-11-01.  The <code>tag</code> scheme is now  published as <a href="http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc4151.txt">RFC 4151</a>.
