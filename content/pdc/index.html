<div></div><p class="first">It is a truth universally acknowledged that <em>Star Trek</em> tells us more about American foreign
   policy than it does about the future. I have recently had occasion to read a couple of
   <em>Trek</em> novels for the first time in years and I find that the future society the stories has
   set in has become a nasty, cynical place in which the only thing you can depend upon is that
   female Vulcans are duplicitous and yet sexy evil-doers.
</p>

<h3> Novels of the TOS</h3>
<p>The two books in question are set in the Original Series milieu of Captain Kirk and company.
   In the past these have been more interesting than, say, Next Generation novels, because so
   much less is known about the TOS era and so the writers could take more liberties. Actually,
   in order that proper fans may avoid wasting time reading this rant, I should come clean and
   admit that the only writer I particularly liked was <a href="http://www.vondanmcintyre.com/">Vonda McIntyre</a>, she who is she who
   wrote <em>The Entropy Effect</em>, the increasingly embellished novelizations of the 1980s <em>Trek</em>
   movies, and an account of Kirk’s first voyage in the <em>Enterprise</em>: all of which are despised
   for her attempts to work around the worst inanities of the films she was adapting.
</p>
<p>There has always been a conflict between Kirk’s (and Picard’s) assertions of the niceness of
   future Earth on the one hand and the lack of any signs of a democratic process or human
   culture (apart from performances of centuries-old plays) on the other; to an extent we can
   rationalize this by saying we are seeing the world from the point of view of the military,
   who necessarily lead stripped-down, austere lives because running a spaceship is complicated
   and dangerous. Some novelists have attempted to hint at the world that cannot be shown
   within the series itself. Some shy away from describing Starfleet as a military
   organization; McIntyre takes the opposite tack: Saavik has a speech that uses the m-word,
   but goes on to establish that the military has a different ethos in Roddenberry’s idealized
   future from that in the average action movie.
</p>

<h3> Spoilers for Star Trek: Vanguard: Harbinger</h3>
<div class="small_photo_right">
<img src="2007/vanguard_cover.jpg" width="180" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I picked up a copy of <em>Harbinger</em>, the first book in a series called Star Trek: Vanguard.
   Why did I pick it up? I thought it was interesting that someone was attempting a new strand
   of Original-Series-era stories forty years on. I’d seen its successor, replete with
   <em>Daedelus</em>-class cruiser on the front, but I thought I should get the first one first.
</p>
<p>To summarize the plot: After a prologue in which a slime mold with lots of chromosomes has
   been discovered, it opens with <em>Enterprise</em> stopping at Starbase 47 <em>Vanguard</em> for repairs.
   While they are there, Starfleet engineers power up an alien subspace transceiver they have
   discovered, which causes the Tholian Assembly to suffer a collective mental seizure. The
   Tholians send ships to nuke the artefact from space, and also destroy the <em>USS Bombay</em>
   because it gets in their way. Starfleet’s activities in this sector are covert, so when a
   journalist tries to work out what’s happened to the <em>Bombay</em>, he is stonewalled then finally
   fed falsified sensor logs to destroy his credibility with his employers.
</p>
<p>You may be thinking ‘That’s an interesting opening gambit; how does it end?’ It is my sad
   duty to inform you that that <em>was</em> the end: this isn’t really a novel, just the first in a
   series of pot-boilers. It’s the same sort of incremental story-telling we have become
   familiar with in TV series like <em>Lost</em> and <em>Carnivàle</em>. I find it intensely annoying. I had
   hoped to see Kirk doing something to thwart the unprincipled going-on amongst the
   <em>Vanguard</em>’s officers; after all, in <em>Entropy Effect</em>, Spock is aghast at the suggestion
   that public records be suppressed or deleted. Instead, in <em>Harbinger</em>, they discover
   falsified data used to slander a licensed journalist and just shrug fatalistically before
   flying off, leaving nothing resolved.
</p>

<h3> Character-Driven to a Fault</h3>
<p>Despite the back-cover blurb, the <em>Enterprise</em> officers aren’t really the main characters:
   the Starbase CO Commodore Diego Reyes and his immediate subordinates are the protagonists,
   if anyone is. I think we are supposed to sympathise with Reyes in his efforts to keep his
   secrets secret—even from the captains of ships he sends in to the danger zone to sort out
   his mess. I’m not sure whether this is intended as an extended parable about how the ‘need
   to know’ culture corrodes trust, fosters corruption, and leads to greater evils and abuses
   than what it is supposedly protecting against, or if these high-handed actions have become a
   commonplace in today’s post-<cite>24</cite> world. Actions including T’Prynn, a Vulcan,
   casually employing extortion, blackmail, slander, deceit and torture on civilians. Weren’t
   Original Series Vulcans supposed to be very big on truth-telling and logic? (And since when
   is Original Series Starfleet peppered with Vulcan officers? I understood Spock to be
   something of a maverick for his decision to join Starfleet.)
</p>
<p>And is it just me, or does <em>Trek</em> feature a few too many woman strutting about in body
   stockings or mini-dresses while brooding on their tragic back-stories? T’Prynn has a hideous
   back-story of such hideousness as to make even Buffy the Vampire Slayer blanch. In fact, in
   this novel it’s back-stories for everybody, presumably to try to engage our sympathy for the
   characters in case the enormity of their actions put us off. The problem is, I don’t care
   about back-stories of characters <em>if don’t care about the characters already</em>. I realize
   that a past life spent enduring exquisite mental or physical torture is practically
   mandatory for Starfleet officers, but couldn’t some of this baggage be saved for later
   episodes in the series when we might actually care? Not that that’s likely when they are all
   duplicitous shits.
</p>
<p>Actually, not everyone is a duplicitous shit in this book. There is a great sequence as the
   <em>USS Bombay</em> heads off ill-prepared for a mission and we follow the chief engineer as he
   struggles to keep it afloat and the bridge crew as they try to find their way through an
   unequal battle. (We’ll ignore the fact that by 2265, Mumbai will have been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai#Name">called Mumbai
for 270 years</a>.) Kevin Judge, the engineer with the ‘clipped Liverpool accent’ I quite
   liked, despite not really knowing what a clipped Liverpool accent sounds like, and a slight
   annoyance that Americans write British characters by having them say ‘git’, which makes as
   much sense as having McCoy call someone a ’tard. To bad it was this lot that had to be
   vaporized.
</p>

<h3> Is There an Alien Race More Annoying Than the Klingons?</h3>
<p>Yes—the Tholians, as it turns out. Well, actually, Tholians are fine when they don’t
   say anything, instead just zipping around in ships that look like they’re straight out of
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(computer_game)#Screenshots">Élite</a>, blowing things up and then vanishing in to the aether. It’s when authors
   attempt to get into their heads and follow their telepathic, untranslatable conversations that I get annoyed.
</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>Humble bride sky rope young passions truth alive alive</i>
   projected Bo’f’lo’f’o-’-po’p the Greyish Greeny Blue syncopatedly,
   disdaining to surround his thought-projections with  marks of quotation.<br/>
</p>
<p> <i>Cling top hammer fast net slowly patroness clinky fop!</i>
   responded Knurpf the Cerise with urgent mauve movements  of his/her 
   psychic brain-horns and a similar contempt for punctuation.
</p>
</blockquote><p>Blah, blah etc. Even those people who insist on pages and pages of dreams in italic text in
   the present tense aren’t quite as annoying as this.
</p>
<p>It gets worse: Starbase 47 manages to have as its neighbours not just the Tholians but also
   the Klingon Empire. This would be OK if they were TOS Klingons, basically crafty, brutal,
   and evil, but at least sane and capable of subtlety, but no! these are the shouty War Yars
   from Next Gen, complete with snippets of <em>tlhIngan Hol</em> and shouting. How do Klingon War
   Yars manage to stop shouting and duelling long enough to actually build and fly spaceships?
   I miss McIntyre’s polyglot, multicultural, sophisticated Klingons, no matter how
   non-canonical true fans find them. I liked they way Spock and random Klingons would
   sometimes have conversations that went completely over Kirk’s ignorant head.
</p>

<h3> So what do I want from a Star Trek Novel?</h3>
<p>First, a story that is complete in one volume; I don’t mind there being an overall arc in to
   which the story fits, but I would like there to be some point to the book. This is a
   complaint I have about a lot of monthly comics as well: it used to be that an episode of
   <em>Fantastic Four</em> would have some supervillain try to do something darstadly and be stopped
   by the time you reached page 22. There would also be references to the previous issue, and
   there would be foreshadowing of the next one, but in the end there was a story that you
   could read on its own. John Byrne wrote and drew my favourite <em>FF</em> stories back in the
   1980s. Now he has hit on the modern formula of having each issue consist of one-third of two
   different stories with the extra third being recaps and other filler: the idea is that it
   becomes impossible to stop buying the comic, because there is always a dangling plotline.
   This may be commercially cunning but artistically it destroys any sense of narrative.
</p>
<p>Second, aliens that are a little more interesting to talk to. And by ‘interesting’, I do not
   mean that they have an unusually shaped martial arts weapon and a legal system based on
   trial by combat. The series <em>Star Trek: DS9</em> probably made the best efforts in this
   direction—the Frengi were created as a feeble parody of capitalist excess, but when this got
   elaborated on it became a quirky society that was both alien enough and understandable
   enough to keep viewers amused. They also had an enemy in the Dominion whose monstrousness
   was extreme but also horribly plausible in a way the shouty Klingons are not.
</p>
<p>Third, at the risk of sounding naïve, the protagonists need to unambiguously the good guys
   struggling against something bad (not necessarily evil). In <em>Harbinger</em>, the Tholians and
   Klingons are acting reasonably (within their understanding of morality) and it is the
   Federation people who are the ones violating every law they have. If you want Starfleet to
   be a sinister conglomeration of unaccountable spies and unprincipled saboteurs in pursuit of
   a Earth-centric agenda, then fine: write a <em>Blake’s 7</em> story with the Federation as the
   enemy and tell it from the point of view of a rag-tag group of Andorians and Vulcans trying
   to rekindle the spirit of democracy. But really I want to see Starfleet prevail <em>because</em>
   they have training, intelligence, and integrity on their side, not in spite of it!
