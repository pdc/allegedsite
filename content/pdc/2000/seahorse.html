      <h1>Damian&rsquo;s SEAHORSE cartoon</h1>
      <p><img src="cafe-492x360.png" width="492" height="360" border="0" alt="" /></p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.seahorse.oxi.net/">SEAHORSE</a>
        is a multilingual, interactive, growing knowledge tree
        for people affected by HIV and AIDS.
        I work for <a href="http://www.oxfordcc.co.uk/">Oxford Computer Consultants Ltd</a>,
        the member of the SEAHORSE consortium.
        OCC&rsquo;s role is the technical development of SEAHORSE.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of the process of
        evolving the visual design for the completed web site
        (something which the project only seriously tackled after all the
        other development was finished) we (Jeremy and I)
        were asked to spend a day or two trying to come up with ideas
        for a title page graphic.  It had often been described as
        being some kind of ‘Internet caf&eacute;’ picture,
        so that is what we did.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cartoon was roundly rejected by the other people on the
        design committee.  We were told it looked like something from
        <cite>Viz</cite> (the English comic, not the American republished of
        Japanese comics), which annoyed me because the art style is
        intended to be in the style of European clear-line comics, not like
        <cite>Viz</cite> at all...
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result this cartoon will never be finished off properly,
        despite a few obvious problems.  The woman at the table is intended
        to be taken as  a doctor but needs a pocket with a stethescope
        to make it more obvious. And if the man at the table is
        supposed to be HIV+, why is his hair so long?
