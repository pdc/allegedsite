Munging HTML before it is Saved
------

To try to reduce confusion I have chosen the term **munger** to refer to the changes made  on the way in to the database, distinct from *filters* used on the way *out*.

<div class="wide_photo_left"><img src="word-to-HTML-2.png" alt="(diagram)" /></div>

How do we arrange for our munging to be performed? The usual routes, like using [hook_nodeapi][], donâ€™t apply to all the situations where the wysiwyg magic is activated.
