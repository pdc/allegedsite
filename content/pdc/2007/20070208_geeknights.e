I’m still abuzz after the [Oxford Geeks Nights #1][1] last night. Working as I do in the slime pits of Microsoft Windows ASP.NET, it was exciting just seeing so many Macs lined up on the stage, their little apple logos glowing in the semidarkness;  the only non-Macs I spotted were running [Ubuntu Linux][2] or similar.  

I haven’t been upstairs at the Jericho Tavern since forever, so I was pleasantly surprised at how salubrious it now is (as music venues go): it has tables and chairs and comfy old leather sofas in dark corners, perfect for hiding in when you don’t know many of the people there.    They also have a screen set up with a projector showing the stage: very useful during gigs, because the space is L-shaped so you often don’t have line-of-sight to the stage; for Geek Nights, if they could work out a way to show the presenters’ presentations on it it would be even cooler.

The format is like a miniature parody of a weekend conference: we had keynotes and then two blocks of tutorial or demo presentations on a variety of subjects, all compressed in to one evening.  So [Simon Willison][3] has to work hard to fit his 22-minute talk on his recent obsession, [OpenID][4]. The joy of [OpenID][5] is that it relieves you of having a bewildering array of logins on different web sites; the flip side is that to *demonstrate* it, you have to create a bewildering array of logins on different web sites.  I’m a big fan of OpenID (and experimented with [TurboGears and OpenID][6] (and [part 2][6]) in a web game I never finished).  Nice to see it so lucidly explained.  Attribute exchange was new to me—I wonder if it means it can replace dauntingly large Single-Sign-On Solutions like [Shibboleth][8].

I don’t use anything so posh as Adobe Photoshop at work, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t enjoy the other keynote, which was about demonstrating some of the new features of the upcoming [Adobe Photoshop CS3][11].  To those of us who grovel about in lesser graphics editors, seeing the new magic selection brush at work had a definite ‘wow’ factor.  Adobe also have some tools for doing reversible transforms on RAW images (where you store the recipe for the final image, rather than creating a new massive raster file), which reminded me of the [Core Image][10] demos from Apple; poor old Adobe presumably have to implement all this cleverness themselves.  The corresponding free software is something called [Gegl][9].

I won’t attempt to cover the lightning (5-minute) talks, except that the second half had a strong mapping theme, whether it was [applying councils’ bus timetables to Google maps in real-time][12], replacing Google maps with something freer, or inventing your own version of the Diagram (the schematic map of the London Underground) through automated graph layout.  (Train-spotting and bus-spotting both in one evening! Whee!)

There were lots of people there—they expected thirty or so and got about a hundred—so it looks like Oxford is more of a hotbed of web alchemy that I had realized.  Met some people I know, and some people I know only from their web sites—if only I were better at asking people their names and then remembering them, I might even be able to claim I had been networking. :-P
