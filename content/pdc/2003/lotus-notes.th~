    <p>
      We have a client who decided that a shared &lsquo;document
      library&rsquo; was the way to collaborate on a bug list. They
      gave me a URL and said to log in with my full name.
    </p>

    <p>
      Obviously they did not really mean my full name, which they do
      not even know. I&nbsp;tried every combination of <samp>p</samp>,
      <samp>d</samp>, <samp>damian</samp>, <samp>cugley</samp> and the
      more obvious misspellings I&nbsp;could think of, to no
      avail. Eventually I&nbsp;logged in using a colleague&rsquo;s
      name. This was not really <a title="Lotus Notes Domino server - look at the length of the URL"
       href="http://www.lotus.com/products/rnext.nsf/22B8141882825B598525693700485E2A/69656A4A3306747885256C31006E5FB6?OpenDocument&cwesite=notes">Lotus Notes</a>&rsquo;s fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing I&nbsp;saw was a frameset. What&rsquo;s bad about framesets is
      that they make it difficult to bookmark documents, or to link to them
      from other web documents (such as my work log). In this case the
      frameset served to present navigation links which were present at the
      bottom of every page anyway. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually I&nbsp;lied&mdash;there were no navigation
      links. Instead there was a grey rectangle (a Java applet) and a
      1997-style Photoshopped backdrop.  The other frame held two grey
      rectangles. After some hefty disc activity, they all displayed
      error messages about missing classes. Feh. I&nbsp;did not see
      the proper layout until I&nbsp;tried it again in <a
      href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix/phoenix-release-notes.html">Phoenix</a>. (I&rsquo;m
      impressed that Gecko&rsquo;s Java support is now more stable
      than MSIE&rsquo;s!)
    </p>
    <p>
      So: a fancy Java applet in order to display a list of
      links. Someone should have told Lotus that HTML can already do
      that. The content frame is another list of links. Thanks to
      their clever Java applet (a)&nbsp;I&nbsp;must double-click the links
      to make them work, and (b)&nbsp;I&nbsp;cannot copy &amp; paste text from
      the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The links to the document pages are truly horrible&mdash;dozens of
      hexadecimal digits followed by <samp>?openDocument</samp>, which
      ensures it cannot be cached (since our proxy does not trust URLs
      containing question marks to be idempotent and safe).
    </p>
    <p>
      I&nbsp;spent the rest of the morning copying their bug reports in to my
      schedule so I&nbsp;can consult them without visiting Lotusland.
    </p>
