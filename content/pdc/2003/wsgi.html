<div></div><p class="first">With all this <a href="http://simonwillison.net/tags/openid/">buzz about OpenID</a> all of a sudden I have been reminded
   of how a while back I was tinkering with a <a href="http://turbogears.org/">TurboGears</a>-based web game
   using <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> (see parts <a href="../2007/../2006/02/10.html" title="TurboGears and OpenID">1</a>, <a href="../2007/../2006/03/06.html" title="TurboGears and OpenID, part 2">2</a>, <a href="../2007/../2006/03/08.html" title="TurboGears and Uploading Pictures">3</a>). Having learned more
   about <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/" title="PEP 333 Python Web Server Gateway Interface v1.0">WSGI</a> and <a href="http://pythonpaste.org/">Python Paste</a> I am inclined to see how far I can
   push the idea of writing web applications using WSGI and a collection of
   WSGI filters as my framework.
</p>

<h2> WSGI and WSGI filters</h2>
<p>The WSGI approach uses a Python callable to represent a web
   application—or part of one, since WSGI apps can be composed in various
   ways to make more complicated apps. An app is a function with a definition
   like this:
</p>
<pre><code>def something_app(environ, start_response):
    ...examine environ and process request...

    start_response(’200 OK’, headers)
    return ...content of response...
</code></pre><p>When the web server receives a request, it puts the information about the
   request in <code>environ</code>, calls <code>something_app</code>, and then uses its return
   value and the headers passed to the <code>start_response</code> function to issue the
   response to the caller.
</p>
<p>WSGI is designed to be used as a common interface for web frameworks, but
   given that it has to pass the information in <code>environ</code> to the application
   code in some way, the <code>environ</code> dictionary is as good a way as any.
   Similarly, your application has to provide the server with status code,
   headers, and response data, and the <code>start_response</code> callable is as good
   away to do that as any. So why not use WSGI as your framework?
   Because your application would have to have its own code for decoding query-strings, setting cookies, and so on, which would mean a lot of tedious repeated code.  But we can address this with filters.
</p>
<p>A WSGI filter is a (higher-order) function that takes a WSGI app and
   returns a new app with slightly modified behaviour. For example, WSGI
   supplies your request’s query-string but does not break it down in to
   parameters. I’ve created a function <code>parse_query_string</code> that does just
   that. I can then define a filter as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>def query_string_filter(app):
    def wrapped_app(environ, start_response):
        environ[’alleged.query_args’] = parse_query_string(
                environ.get(’QUERY_STRING’, ‘’))
        return app(environ, start_response)
    return wrapped_app
</code></pre><p>This takes a function—here called <code>app</code>—that requires an extra entry
   in the <code>environ</code> dictionary and makes a working WSGI app.  Python has a special syntax for applying functions to functions this way: you can write
</p>
<pre><code>@query_string_filter
def my_app(environ, start_response):
    ... code that exploits environ[’alleged.query_args’] ...
</code></pre><p>This use of higher-order functions to simplify writing WSGI apps is called
   middleware in the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/" title="PEP 333 Python Web Server Gateway Interface v1.0">WSGI</a> documentation.
</p>
<p>Why does the key start with <code>alleged.</code>? Simply to avoid name clashes with
   other middleware that also works by adding extra entries to the <code>environ</code>
   dictionary. The particular prefix I’ve chosen is taken from Alleged
   Literature, our mini-comic publishing imprint from the 1990s. The
   <code>alleged</code> prefix is also part of the package names for the reusable
   filters. I suppose if I ever finished it I could add the Alleged
   Microframework to the eleventy-one Python web frameworks. But don’t hold
   your breath.
</p>

<h2> Log-in filter</h2>
<p>One of the complaints about OpenID is that so far the number of consumers
   (web sites that allow you to log in with your OpenID) is much lower than
   the number of providers—this is natural, because it is much easier to
   bolt an OpenID server on the side of an existing application than to rip
   out its custom user database and replace it with one generic enough to
   accept OpenIDs as well. The first wave of OpenID consumers will be
   applications written with OpenID in mind from the start. Many, like
   <a href="http://zoomr.com/" title="Like Flickr, except with black backgrounds">Zoomr</a> and <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2006/Dec/19/openid/">Simon Willison’s blog comments</a>, use OpenID as their
   only authentication scheme. So I decided to have a go at making a log-in
   system with pluggable authentication, but to only supply an OpenID
   plug-in for now.
</p>
<p>My log-in ‘framework’ (if that’s not too grand a word) consists of just
   two functions. First, <code>log_in_filter</code> is a more elaborate version of the
   filter (middleware) functions described above. It roughly corresponds to
   <a href="../2007/../2006/03/06.html" title="TurboGears and OpenID, part 2">Part 2</a> of my TurboGears+OpenID experiment: the wrapped app checks
   for the log-in cookie before each request, and if no-one is logged in
   then it redirects to a <code>login</code> page (with one exception: you do not need
   to be logged in to visit the login page). At the end of each request, it
   updates the log-in cookie.
</p>
<p>The second function, <code>log_in_and_redirect</code>, is for use by the
   implementation of the log-in page: it takes the user name as an
   argument, and redirects to the page that the user originally requested.
   You call it instead of calling <code>start_response</code> directly.
</p>
<p>What’s missing from this is the log-in page itself: it must be one of the
   pages in the wrapped app, because it has to be able to communicate the
   user’s login name back to <code>log_in_filter</code>. It also has to be careful to
   preserve the query-string parameter <code>next</code>; the most straightforward way
   to do this is to have the log-in form use <code>request_uri(environ)</code> as its
   <code>action</code> attribute and also specify <code>method="post"</code>.
</p>
<p>Leaving the log-in page to the application allows any form of user name
   and authentication to be used, including elaborate single-sign-on servers
   and exotic smart-cards. Because the <code>log_in_filter</code> does not need to know
   anything about the method of authentication, it needs a lot less
   configuration than it might otherwise do.
</p>

<h2> Plugging in OpenID</h2>
<p>The next step is creating a log-in page that works via OpenID. So far I
   have taken the code from <a href="../2007/../2006/02/10.html" title="TurboGears and OpenID">Part 1</a> of my TurboGears version and beaten
   it roughly in to shape. Unlike the TurboGears version—which used
   separate URIs for each stage of the OpenID handshake—it uses the same
   <code>login</code> URI for displaying the form, handling the user’s POST, and
   handling the redirect back from the OpenID provider. The first and last
   of these are implementing the same method (GET) but we can tell the which
   is which by looking for the <code>token</code> argument amongst the query
   parameters.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have not yet been able to test this, since I have not yet
   managed to get Pysqlite2 (needed to set up the OpenID database) installed
   in Python 2.5 on my Mac as yet: I get an error message to the effect that
   GCC 4.0 does not exist, so it looks like I need to trawl through the
   Apple developer documentation to see what I need to do to get the
   compiler to work. Grr.
</p>
<p>Ah well.  Maybe next weekend...?
