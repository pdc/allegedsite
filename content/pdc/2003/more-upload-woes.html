      <h1>More trouble with uploads and CGI</h1>
      <p id="tagline">Damian Cugleyâ€™s Weblog</p>
      
      <p class="article">
      So far getting uploads to work with the
      <a href="picky.html">Picky Picky Game</a> is an uphill
      struggle.  Some web browsers work and some do not, and it is
      going to require some fancy diagnostic tools to find out why
      not.
      </p>
      <p>
      <a hrf="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> works fine,
      except when it doesn&rsquo;t.  I often get an alert saying the
      request failed &lsquo;because the network connection was
      reset. This sometimes occurs when the server is busy.&rsquo;
      Apparently I am not the only one&mdash;I found a reference to
      this message on a <a
      href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/user/view/cs_msg/14535">O&rsquo;Reilly
      network message board</a>.  If I try the request again it
      usually works the second time.
      </p>
      <p>
      If, however, I was trying to submit a form, and the form had
      <code>method="post"</code> and
      <code>enctype="multipart/form-data"</code>, then
      some weird things happen.
      First of all, although what I&nbsp;see is the filled-in form,
      I cannot
      repeat the request by clicking on the Submit button&mdash;it
      does nothing.  If I click on the Reload button (which I would
      have expected to reload the form, not resubmit it), then the
      form is submitted again, but! my CGI script sees
      <code>REQUEST_METHOD="GET"</code> (as opposed to
      <code>POST</code>).  Since my script distinguishes between
      these two verbs, it fails with  a 404 error code.
      I&nbsp;believe these behaviours might be bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
      I have also tried Microsoft Internet Explorer (Mac OS X
      version).  When I&nbsp;submit a form with an uploaded file it
      simply spins forever&mdash;it apparently never finishes the
      upload.
      </p>
      <p>
      I also installed <a
      href="http://mozilla.org/projects/camino/">Camino</a>, a Gecko +
      Cocoa browser.  When I try to submit the upload form I see the
      &lsquo;barber pole&rsquo; progress indicator for a long while,
      then it displays an error message from my CGI script indicating
      it was interrupted by the server (<code>thttpd</code>) for taking
      too long.
      </p>
      <p>
      All three mentioned above are running on my shiny new <a
      href="http://www.apple.com/uk/powerbook/index12.html">PowerBook
      12&Prime;</a>, running Mac OS&nbsp;X version 10.2.5,
      connecting to my <code>thttpd</code> server over Ethernet.
      </p>
      <p>
      I have also tried Microsoft Internet Explorer 5&frac12; running
      on Windows NT 4.0.  It exhibits the same behaviour as Camino.
      This was the bug that I&nbsp;discussed  <a
      href="../2002/11.html#e20021111">a while back</a>, where
      the script gets wedged reading  the data uploaded by its
      caller.
      </p>
      <p>
      Meanwhile things work fine on my Linux box&mdash;at least with
      Opera&nbsp;5, which is the most recent web browser I&nbsp;have
      installed thereon (my Red Hat 6.2 installation is too primitive
      for more modern browsers).
      </p>
      <p>
      Apart from some arguably buggy behaviour from Safari, presumably
      there are nuances about the way these various programs interpret
      the rules for submitting forms that are foxing my CGI script.
      Obviously I&nbsp;have tried using a script that simply
      regurgitates what it reads, but the various infinite-pause
      behaviours happen <em>while it is reading in the
      data</em>&mdash;and if it cannot get that far then there is not
      much for it to report...  I need to write some sort of
      fiendishly clever one-byte-at-a-time system that is somehow
      clever enough not to be fooled by lying
      <code>Content-length</code> headers or transitory network
      problems.  Or line endings, though I thought I had carefully
      taken line-ending variations in to account.  Sigh.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Update:</strong> After adding some xtra instrumentation
      to my CGI script, it appears that when the request is from MSIE
      it receives 1408 bytes or so, from Camino 1344 bytes or so.
      I&nbsp;begin to suspect a dodgy network stack on my creaky Linux
      box&mdash;I am tempted to believe those numbers could represent
      a 1500-byte packet minus the header info...
      </p>
      <p>
      Also, now I have installed the application on a different web
      server, and the uplaoding of files appears to happen without a
      hitch&mdash;it then fails to save them to disc because Apache is
      running as a user with insifficuent privs to create the
      directory.  But at least the upload works!
