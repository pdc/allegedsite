<div></div><p class="first">I’m still abuzz after the <a href="http://oxford.geeknights.net/2007/february-7th/">Oxford Geeks Nights #1</a> last night. Working as I do in the slime pits of Microsoft Windows ASP.NET, it was exciting just seeing so many Macs lined up on the stage, their little apple logos glowing in the semidarkness;  the only non-Macs I spotted were running <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" title="Linux for Human Beings">Ubuntu Linux</a> or similar.<br/>
</p>
<p>I haven’t been upstairs at the Jericho Tavern since forever, so I was pleasantly surprised at how salubrious it now is (as music venues go): it has tables and chairs and comfy old leather sofas in dark corners, perfect for hiding in when you don’t know many of the people there.    They also have a screen set up with a projector showing the stage: very useful during gigs, because the space is L-shaped so you often don’t have line-of-sight to the stage; for Geek Nights, if they could work out a way to show the presenters’ presentations on it it would be even cooler.

<p>The format is like a miniature parody of a weekend conference: we had keynotes and then two blocks of tutorial or demo presentations on a variety of subjects, all compressed in to one evening.  So <a href="http://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison</a> has to work hard to fit his 22-minute talk on his recent obsession, <a href="http://simonwillison.net/tags/openid/" title="Simon’s articles on OpenID">OpenID</a>. The joy of <a href="http://openid.org/" title="Official OpenID web site">OpenID</a> is that it relieves you of having a bewildering array of logins on different web sites; the flip side is that to <em>demonstrate</em> it, you have to create a bewildering array of logins on different web sites.  I’m a big fan of OpenID (and experimented with <a href="../2007/../2006/02/10.html" title="TurboGears and OpenID">TurboGears and OpenID</a> (and <a href="../2007/../2006/02/10.html" title="TurboGears and OpenID">part 2</a>) in a web game I never finished).  Nice to see it so lucidly explained.  Attribute exchange was new to me—I wonder if it means it can replace dauntingly large Single-Sign-On Solutions like <a href="http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/" title="Shibboleth Project—Internet2 Middleware">Shibboleth</a>.

<p>I don’t use anything so posh as Adobe Photoshop at work, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t enjoy the other keynote, which was about demonstrating some of the new features of the upcoming <a href="http://www.macworld.com/2006/12/firstlooks/photoshopcs3/" title="Macworld: First Look: Adobe Photoshop CS3">Adobe Photoshop CS3</a>.  To those of us who grovel about in lesser graphics editors, seeing the new magic selection brush at work had a definite ‘wow’ factor.  Adobe also have some tools for doing reversible transforms on RAW images (where you store the recipe for the final image, rather than creating a new massive raster file), which reminded me of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/coreimage/">Core Image</a> demos from Apple; poor old Adobe presumably have to implement all this cleverness themselves.  The corresponding free software is something called <a href="http://gegl.org/">Gegl</a>.
</p>
<p>I won’t attempt to cover the lightning (5-minute) talks, except that the second half had a strong mapping theme, whether it was <a href="http://www.livebus.org/">applying councils’ bus timetables to Google maps in real-time</a>, replacing Google maps with something freer, or inventing your own version of the Diagram (the schematic map of the London Underground) through automated graph layout.  (Train-spotting and bus-spotting both in one evening! Whee!)
</p>
<p>There were lots of people there—they expected thirty or so and got about a hundred—so it looks like Oxford is more of a hotbed of web alchemy that I had realized.  Met some people I know, and some people I know only from their web sites—if only I were better at asking people their names and then remembering them, I might even be able to claim I had been networking. :-P<br/>
