       This  command  reads the next line from _c_h_a_n_n_e_l_I_d, returns
       everything in the line up to (but not including) the  end-
       of-line character(s), and discards the end-of-line charac­
       ter(s).  If _v_a_r_N_a_m_e is omitted the line is returned as the
       result  of  the command.  If _v_a_r_N_a_m_e is specified then the
       line is placed in the variable by that name and the return
       value is a count of the number of characters returned.

       If  end  of file occurs while scanning for an end of line,
       the command returns whatever input is available up to  the
       end  of  file.   If  _c_h_a_n_n_e_l_I_d  is in nonblocking mode and
       there is not a full line of input available,  the  command
       returns  an  empty  string and does not consume any input.
       If _v_a_r_N_a_m_e is specified and an empty string is returned in
       _v_a_r_N_a_m_e  because of end-of-file or because of insufficient
       data in nonblocking mode, then the  return  count  is  -1.
       Note that if _v_a_r_N_a_m_e is not specified then the end-of-file
       and no-full-line-available  cases  can  produce  the  same
       results  as if there were an input line consisting only of
       the end-of-line character(s).  The eeooff and  ffbblloocckkeedd  com­
       mands can be used to distinguish these three cases.
