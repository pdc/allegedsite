      What do you know, I have ground out <a
      href="percy/percy-3.html">another page</a> of my <a
      href="percy/percy-1.html">comic strip</a>.  Strangely enough,
      despite being the title character, Percy has yet to actually
      have any lines.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The book Percy is buying is <a
      href="http://books.cambridge.org/0521653908.htm">Kathleen
      O.&nbsp;Irace&rsquo;s edition of the First Quarto of
      <cite>Hamlet</cite> (Cambridge University Press, 1998)</a>.  The
      show he saw is based on <a
      href="http://www.rstc.dircon.co.uk/ham%20copy.html"><cite>Hamlet
      First Cut</cite></a>, a production by <a
      href="http://www.rstc.dircon.co.uk">Red Shift Theatre
      Company</a> with costumes by Red or Dead.  This was touring in
      1999 and 2000; for the purposes of this story, I&nbsp;have
      pretended it was showing in Oxford earlier in the present year.

      Meanwhile Jeremy has celebrated <a title="Miscellaneous Monday
      (Cleanskies's LiveJournal)"
      href="http://cleanskies.livejournal.com/99151.html">finishing a
      3-page commission</a> by dashing off <a
      title="110. Pornographer's Diary"
      href="../../jrd/2003/20030709.html">a weekly strip</a> on the
      subject.
