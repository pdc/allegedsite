<div></div><p class="first">I have written [a short note about using <code>make</code> and <code>sed</code> with Markdown
   to maintain a collection of HTML documents][0]. Programmers are forever writing
   documentation (proposals, specifications, technical notes, and so on),
   and the latest stage in my quest to make writing prose as frictionless
   as possible
   I have started using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> to do this.
   Before that I wrote in HTML with some XML mixed in to better handle
   sectioning; before that I used Microsoft Word.
</p>
<p>The <a href="../2005/../../2005/marky/">aformentioned note</a> gives the details of how this works. The
   rest of <em>this</em> note discusses why I’m not using Microsoft Word.
</p>

<h2> Writing with Word is not frictionless</h2>
<p>Most of my managers would expect me to use Microsoft Word to write
   proposals and specifications and the like. This makes some sense
   because, not being developers, the spend most of their time plugging
   away in Microsoft Office, so Word is always to hand. But I instead <em>program</em> for a
   living: I typically have three text editors open at once (Microsoft
   Visual Studio .NET 2003, the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/">Pythonwin IDE</a>, and <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a>), so dashing
   out a note in a text editor is the natural thing to do. When
   I do use Word I waste time
   struggling against its officious auto-lousification features.
   <a href="../2005/../../jrd/">Jeremy</a>’s description of it as being like a bolshy secretary is very
   apt; it is so annoying that there is a whole industry growing around the
   <a href="http://www.wopr.com/books/annoyword97.htm">_Word Annoyances_</a> books.
</p>
<p>Besides, we are all web developers now, and should always be looking for
   a chance to sharpen our HTML skills and practice organizing documents for the Web.
</p>

<h2> Word documents are not good to read</h2>
<p>Word is worse for reading on-line than HTML. When colleagues and
   customers send us documents in Word format, I cringe. I have to wait
   while the word processor drags its bloated code off the hard drive and
   in to memory, and eventually opens a window in which the document in
   question is displayed at some random zoom level and view mode chosen by
   the last person to edit it.
</p>
<p>Word documents do not sit comfortably on the company intranet. Not that
   anyone seems to have the wit to appreciate that being able to refer to
   documents by URL would save a lot of time that instead we waste digging
   though old mail messages or obscure file shares looking for ‘the DTI
   spec’ (which is not named that, of course).
</p>
<p>With HTML pages on an intranet server, it is easy to have
   cross-references between documents, to write index pages, even share
   them with clients via an extranet server. You can have links from bug
   reports to the relevant section of the specification or what-have-you.
</p>

<h2> Word documents are ugly</h2>
<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pdc/1911118/" title="Wishing well (on Flickr)">&lt;img src="http://photos2.flickr.com/1911118_2e55e0f904_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="" align="right" /&gt;</a>
   But surely we can exploit the extra formatting features Word offers to
   make documents of rare clarity and great beauty? Yes, and, back when I
   wrote position papers in Word, I carefully chose fonts and adjusted the
   layout of headings to make the documents look nice and read well. I even
   persuaded the powers at be to let me buy a Bitstream 500-font CD so we
   could use <a href="http://www.linotype.com/13564/plantinroman-font.html#more">Plantin</a> rather than Times Roman. I made these changes
   using Styles so that formatting was consistent throughout the document.
   I discovered how to make a Code style that used <a href="http://www.linotype.com/12641/univers55roman-font.html#more">Univers 55</a> to represent
   computer text and suppressed the spell-checker. I even worked out how to
   attach this style to a keyboard shortcut so I could write technical
   documents with lots of computer text in. I spent ages arguing with the
   automatic header-numbering dialogues until they numbered the headings
   properly, and I tweaked the table of contents to make it more usable. I
   organized my documents carefully so as to avoid convoluted and heavily
   nested sub-sub-subheadings. I felt this was the least I needed to do to
   produce documents of an acceptable standard that could be shown to
   clients.
</p>
<p>In this regard, I am unique. Normal people use the wizz-bang features of
   Word to create ugly, unstructured documents that use fonts too small to
   read on the screen, and lines too long to read comfortably on paper. The
   least bad examples are when they leave the default, ugly, heading
   formats in place. When they attempt impose a style of their own it is
   far worse.
</p>

<h2> Concentrate on the words, not Word</h2>
<p>Another things that irritates me (and is not entirely relevant to this
   discussion) is that so little thought goes in to writing these words.
   Another way in which I am freakishly divergent from the norm is that the
   second thing I put in every paper is a line with the revision
   number, the date, and my name. The idea is that (a) it should be easy to
   discover whether one is reading the latest version, and (b) if there are
   questions, it is possible to ask someone. An undated document headed ‘Bugs in
   Frobomatic’ followed by a list of complaints will soon be useless
   because it does not say which version of the software, or whom to ask
   for details about the bugs.
</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pdc/630282/" title="Bodford (on Flickr)">&lt;img src="http://photos1.flickr.com/630282_0be34102c7_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="" align="left" /&gt;</a>
   I used to make a point of numbering documents (something might be Tech
   Note #3) and number headings in documents and in some cases even
   paragraphs. This way you could refer to TN3, &sect;4.2 concisely rather
   than ‘The one about the database thingummy that Jared mailed you in June
   I think, about halfway through, headed Issues with User Authentication
   (or do I mean Authorization?), about four paragraphs in’. I even wrote
   scripts to automagically number headings in HTML documents, <em>and</em>
   provide anchors so I could link directly to a certain section of a
   certain document. I have since given up: nobody cares. 
</p>

<h2> Conclusion</h2>
<p>Too many people spend hundreds of pounds on word-processing software so
   that they may spend hundreds of hours writing documents, but then
   neglect to spend a minute or two ensuring these documents will be
   citeable, findable and readable. 
</p>
<p>For writing technical prose, the formatting features of word processors
   are a distraction at best. Programmers especially would be better off
   spending their time getting really good with a decent text editor.
