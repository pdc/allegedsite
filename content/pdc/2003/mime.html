<div></div><p class="first">There has been all sorts of trouble with web developers being unable to
   cause their web servers to issue the correct <code>Content-type</code> headers. 
   Most recent fallout was <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/07/21/dive.html" title="XML on the Web Has Failed">Mark Pilgrim’s essay on XML.com</a>. 
</p>

<h3> The problem</h3>
<p>Suppose I have several  HTML files, some in ISO 8859-1 and the newer ones saved as UTF-8.
   How do I arrange for my web server to serve them tagged
   as <code>text/html; charset=ISO8859-1</code> and <code>text/html; charset=UTF-8</code> respectively?
</p>
<p>Most web servers guess the media-type based on the file name suffix
   (so <code>.html</code> &rarr; <code>text/html</code>, and so on).
   I have seen sites where different suffixes are used for
   different encodings (<code>index.htm8</code>), but that seems kind of a kludge. You
   could mandate the server to parse the file looking for <code>meta</code> tags with
   attribute <code>http-equiv="content-type"</code>, but that presumes that the server
   can understand subtleties of HTML parsing, and it will take up extra resources on the
   server.
</p>
<p>To address this problem I am proposing a
   simple resource format called META (for metadata). 
</p>
<p>The format (which I shall
   not define in detail here) is essentially the same as RFC 822 headers:
</p>
<pre>
Content-type: text/html; charset=ISO8859-1
Title: My plan for world peace
</pre>

<p>Processors should scan this file considered as an octet-sequence
   (i.e., as bytes, not characters), in the fashion mandated by MIME and RFC 822
   and the rest. Keywords are therefore always US-ASCII. The
   permitted keywords include:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
      <code>Content-type</code>, the MIME media type, with parameters;
 </li>

 <li>
      <code>Title</code>: the title to use for this resource; and
 </li>

 <li>
      <code>Link</code>: links to other documents, with <code>rel</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>type</code>
  attributes corresponding to the HTML equivalents.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>The point of the META is that it is very simple and it can be used to
   supply the correct MIME <code>content-type</code> header. 
   I am assuming that if I (or my web-page editing program) can I upload
   <code>peace-plan.html</code> to my web server, I can  
   also upload <code>peace-plan.meta</code>. 
</p>
<p>META-savvy
   Web servers use the
   META files associated with a resource to tell them how to serve said
   resources. This should not be too hard; code for
   scanning RFC-822 headers exists and is available as a library for most
   platforms.
</p>
<p>As a convenience, they might, if the file-specific metadata
   file is missing, look for <code>html.meta</code> in (a) the directory that the
   HTML file is in, and (b) in a server-wide set of defaults. (Obviously
   these META files should not contain titles.) There might be
   operating-system-specific options, such as  
   resource forks on HFS+ file systems.
</p>
<p>This implies two file-system accesses per request, at least the first
   time a file is served. I would suggest that the META files are small
   enough that caching them (or the information extracted from them)
   should not be difficult. Servers could also ‘compile’ metadata ahead of
   time in to an in-memory database.
</p>

<h3> Application outside of HTML and HTTP</h3>
<p>This is not intended to be limited to HTML files; on the contrary, METAs are
   are designed to be format-neutral:
</p>
<pre>
Content-type: image/jpeg
Title: Kittens and string
Link: &lt;kitten46.jpg&gt;; rel=next
Link: &lt;kitten44.jpg&gt;; rel=prev
</pre>

<p>Pictures can have titles, and links
   (I was going to link to the HTTP/1.1 definition of
   <code>Link</code> and <code>Title</code>, but then discovered that HTTP/1.1 does not have them any more!
   The syntax above is modelled on the examples in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/present/styles.html#h-14.6" title="14.6 Linking to style sheets with HTTP headers">HTML 4.0 &amp;sect;14.6</a>.)
</p>
<p>The web server thus does not have to understand JPEG text annotations to
   serve JPEGs with metadata; on the other hand, a separate program might be used to scan
   JPEGs for metadata and spit out META files for the server to absorb.
</p>

<h3> On the file system</h3>
<p>All the above is not restricted to web servers. When one opens a
   document by double-clicking in your file browser, it should be able to
   use META information to decide how to display the file. This might go
   some what to reduce the annoyance caused when the GUI’s understanding of
   file-types is wrong.
</p>
<p>There is the worry that now there are two files where once there was one
   – won’t those hapless users get them confused, split them up, delete
   one and not the other, forget to copy both of them, etc.? Actally HTML
   documents already have this problem, since all their included images,
   CSS files, and so on are also separate files.
   Microsoft have
   gone to great lengths to address this problem by adding extra complexity
   to Windows Explorer – all the extra files go in a specially named
   directory that the Explorer windows may hide from you and may copy about
   automatically. There are some obvious alternatives if you really want to treat a
   collection of HTML pages as a single document:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     treat a specially named directory of HTML pages in a fashion similar to an
       application directory (app dirs are a concept used in <a href="http://rox.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/" title="ROX desktop system">ROX</a>, called an application
  bundles in <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/macosx/" title="Apple Mac OS X">Mac OS X</a>);
 </li>

 <li>
     combine HTML and its resources as [MIME <code>multipart/related</code>][5] with a
  document file name ending <code>.mht</code> (in this case the META resources might be 
  folded in with the MIME headers);
 </li>

 <li>
     combine HTML and its resources as a ZIP archive (like a JAR or WAR).
 </li>
</ul>
<p>  document file name ending <code>.mht</code> (in this case the META resources might be 
     folded in with the MIME headers);
     * combine HTML and its resources as a ZIP archive (like a JAR or WAR).
</p>

<h3> Applicability to XML served as <code>text/xml</code> </h3>
<p>This also would permit XML to use <code>text/xml</code> as a media-type:
</p>
<pre>
Content-type: text/xml; charset=ISO8859-7
Title: =?ISO-8859-7?B?...greek text...?=
</pre>

<p>The web server does not have to be XML-savvy to generate correct
   headers; it only needs to understand the META file and then serve the
   file unaltered. In many cases the META file can be dropped in to the
   HTTP
   headers unaltered.
</p>
<p>If XML files did not have the <code>encoding</code> pseudo-attribute in the
   <code>&lt;?xml...?&gt;</code> pseudo-processing-instruction at the start, then transcoding would now
   be a non-issue: a transcoding proxy server transcodes the character data
   and rewrites the MIME <code>content-type</code>, neither of which are XML-specific.
   A program that transcodes a file on disc must also know to locate and
   alter the META file, but, again, this is not an XML-specific task.
   (These
   utilities might have to be written specially for your XML work, but
   would be generally applicable.)
</p>
<p>I do not want to dismiss lightly the clever scheme the XML committee
   came up with for having a file describe its own encoding in a standard
   way. But, speaking purely in the context of counterfactual historical fiction,
   I do think that there would have been advantages to instead
   taking the following approach:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     Create a separate RFC for the META files outlined in this
       note and recommend it as best practice foe web servers;
 </li>

 <li>
     Insist that XML files be processed as character data, with the
       encoding specified via a META file, or HTTP or MIME headers, or
       application-specific and
       operating-system-specific alternatives (such as command-line
       arguments, Windows’ use of byte-order marks to distinguish MCBS and 
       UTF-16 files, 
       and Mac OS resources);
 </li>

 <li>
     Forbid a document from referring to its own encoding.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>  application-specific and
     operating-system-specific alternatives (such as command-line
     arguments, Windows’ use of byte-order marks to distinguish MCBS and 
     UTF-16 files, 
     and Mac OS resources);
     * Forbid a document from referring to its own encoding.
</p>
<p>The intention being to oblige applications to handle character encodings
   and media-types properly in general, rather than working around their
   existing failings in a fashion that works for XML only.
