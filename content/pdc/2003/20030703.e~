      If you&rsquo;ve been wondering why I&rsquo;ve not added anything
      to my site for the last few weeks, it&rsquo;s because I have
      been spending my spare time playing with <a href="06/12.html">my new graphics tablet</a> instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      There have a been two or three hypothetical comics projects
      bubbling in my brain for years now&mdash;I&nbsp;just draw too
      slowly to get anything done.  I&nbsp;do, after all have a
      full-time job which also takes a lot of creative effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here are the two pages I&nbsp;have produced so far&mdash;not
      a complete story, I&rsquo;m afraid.  This is something I started
      drawing at the comics tea-party last month, using the Painter
      program that came with my graphics tablet.  The panels are each
      drawn as sperate images, the sizes chosen to fit together in to
      a page 512 pixels wide.  They are drawn at three times the
      resolution used for the on-line version; the 300-dpi version
      might in principle be used for an A5 printed version.
