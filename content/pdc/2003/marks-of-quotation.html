      <h1>Marks of Quotation</h1>

      <p class="article">
      I once visited a real printing house, and discovered that the
      keyboards actually have two quotation-mark keys: one for the
      apostrophe (&rsquo;) and one for the inverted comma
      (&lsquo;). Alas! That such simplicity was denied to us by, well,
      by Apple.
      </p>
      <p>
      <a
      href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/">Donald&nbsp;E. Knuth</a>
      could not depend on anything beyond the limited repertoire of
      7-bit ASCII (ISO-646, essentially), so had to use the otherwise
      useless quote (<samp>'</samp>) and backquote (<samp>`</samp>)
      characters as substitutes. The result was that English
      typesetting was actually fairly reasonable:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><code>I said `She said ``Foo!'', and meant it.'</code></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      becomes
      </p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>I said &lsquo;She said &ldquo;Foo!&rdquo;, and meant
      it.&rsquo;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      This was in 1982.  Twenty-one years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
      When Apple designed the Macintosh they gave it its own file
      system, bitmap fonts, screen and keyboard.  This was in an era
      when <em>everyone</em> was designing their own character sets.
      There was nothing stopping them from having 2&nbsp;keys for the
      quotation marks&mdash;or from mapping code points 0x27 and 0x60
      in their proprietary character set on to the apostrophe (now
      Unicode U+2019) and turned comma (U+2018). They went part way to
      proper punctuation, allowing access via obscure keystrokes using
      the Option key.  This extra complexity lead to the impression
      that proper punctuation was a difficult alternative to the
      default of bashing on the <kbd>'</kbd> key.  Hence the term
      <dfn>smart punctuation</dfn> to describe what could have been
      the default.
      </p>
      <p>
      SGML came along. They did not adopt Knuth&rsquo;s sensible
      kludge, preferring to use elements to enclose quotations:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><code>I said &lt;q&gt;She said &lt;q&gt;Foo!&lt;/q&gt;, and
      meant it.&lt;/q&gt;</code></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      With complicated rules for working out whether single or double
      marks are required (whereas the TeX system is simple and
      foolproof).
      </p>
      <p>
      The requirement that element start and end tags match causes
      trouble in those situations where English tradition includes
      unmatched symbols (such as at the start of a new paragraph if a
      quotation extends beyond one paraqraph). It is also much more
      intrusive than the TeX style.
      </p>
      <p>
      What does it
      gain us to force one particular gramatical structure,
      quotations, to be reflected in the XML structure of the
      document? We do not require sentences to be marked up so that
      the full stops be added!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><code>&lt;sentence class="question"&gt;what does it gain us to
      force one particular gramatical structure &lt;parenthesis
      class="comma"&gt;quotations&lt;/parenthesis&gt; to be reflected
      in the &lt;acronym&gt;xml&lt;/acronym&gt; structure of the
      document&lt;/sentence&gt; &lt;sentence class="exclamation"&gt;we
      do not require sentences to be marked up so that the full stops
      be added&lt;/sentence&gt;</code></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      <abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr>&nbsp;4
      added its own <code>q</code> element, but no web browsers
      support it&mdash;at least none that I know of. In desperation
      the <abbr title="Cascading Style-Sheet">CSS</abbr> standard was
      <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/generate.html#before-after-content">augmented</a>
      <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/generate.html#content">with</a>
      <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/generate.html#quotes">features</a>
      to force browsers to insert quote marks&mdash;a huge burden on
      CSS processors to crack this fairly pointless nut.
      </p>
      <p>
      It also means loss of CSS removes the
      quotation marks!
      </p>
      <p>
      The way to get English punctutation is to use the correct
      Unicode characters. You should be able to use
      <code>&amp;lsquo;</code> to get an inverted comma and
      <code>&amp;rsquo;</code> to get an apostrophe. Some browsers do
      not yet support these HTML-4 character entities, so perhaps
      numeric entities (<code>&amp;#x2018;</code>,
      <code>&amp;#x2019;</code>) are better. Alas!  Older browsers
      require numeric entities to be in decimal
      (<code>&amp;#8216;</code>, <code>&amp;#8217;</code>), which is
      annoying because Unicode numbers are conventionally always shown
      in hex...
      </p>
      <p>
      All of these options are much more intrusive than Knuth&rsquo;s
      convention.
      </p>
      <p>
      There are now some Unicode-savvy text editors that allow one to
      store proper punctuation in your document, so long as you
      somehow manage to type them in the first place. Presumably on a
      Mac you can still use those Option key keystrokes. On Windows
      you use Character Map or one or two apps that try to guess which
      quotation mark you intended when you pressed the quote
      key. Sigh.
      </p>

      It&rsquo;s crazy that my keyboard has <kbd>¬</kbd>,
      <kbd>|</kbd>, <kbd>`</kbd>, <kbd>~</kbd>, etc. keys, but not the
      punctuation marks we were all taught at school.

      <p id="reply">
        <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=pdc&amp;itemid=3189#t629">An anonymous poster</a> points out some browsers <em>do</em> support
        <code>q</code> elements.
      </p>
      
      <p>Obviously I was remembering an older version of Mozilla&mdash;my information is out of date, sorry! I just tried it again, and it sort-of works.  Here&rsquo;s what that phrase comes out as in whatever browser you are using right now:
      </p>
      <blockquote><p>I said <q>She said <q>Foo!</q> and meant it</q>.</p></blockquote>
      <p>
      In Phoenix 0.5 and Opera 5 this comes out as:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>I said "She said "Foo!" and meant it".</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Which means that, yes, the <code>q</code> tag does do something, but, alas! does not use the correct punctuation marks... :-(
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The main bug for Mozilla quotes is <a title="Initial value for &#39;quotes&#39; property could be nicer [GC]" href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16206">16206</a>.  They say that they don&rsquo;t support inner quotes at all, and  adding multiple languages is going to be horribly inefficient.</p>
      
      <p>In fact <a
      href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24861">It&rsquo;s
      really hard to work out quoting depth properly</a>, because
      <em>any</em> HTML element can be set to have quotation-mark-inserting
      properties!  This is because by the time you add enough features to
      CSS&nbsp;2 to specify quotation marks, these new features can be
      combined in strange ways that are tough to implement correctly and
      efficiently.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      I stand by my claim that trying to make <code>q</code> do the right
      thing in the general case has required and will require enormous
      programming effort, and that being able to just type in the quotation
      marks oneself would be immesurably simpler and more transparent!
      </p>
      
      <p>Also... apostrophes also appear in non-quote contexts, and
      <code>q</code> does nothing to help there.</p>
