<div></div><p class="first">I want to convert some images to GIFs.  Why do Corel want me not to be
   able to do this?
</p>

<h2> The problem</h2>
<p>I have several dozen files in Corel Painter’s format RIFF. I can use
   Painter to convert images one at a time to GIF by opening the image and
   doing File &rarr; Clone followed by File &rarr; Save As.  But with
   several dozen images this gets tedious.  Why can’t I automate this? 
</p>

<h2> How it should work</h2>
<p>Suppose my images were PNGs and I wanted GIFs.  Then I could write a
   Python program to do this along these lines:
</p>
<pre><code>for name in os.listdir(inDir):
    im = Image.open(os.path.join(inDir, name))
    im.save(os.path.join(outDir, name[:-4] + ‘.gif’), ‘GIF’)
</code></pre><p>Too bad <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a> does not support RIFF, because RIFF is a closed,
   proprietary format (NOTE: not to be confused with <a href="../2006/15.html" title="The RIFF that is known is not the true RIFF">other formats called RIFF</a>).
</p>
<p>Too bad there is no standard format for images that includes layers and
   suchlike that Corel could have Painter support.  (Actually you could
   represent images with layers pretty well using <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG</a> if you wanted.)
</p>
<p>Corel could supply a library for working with RIFF images. Failing that, Corel
   could publish a description of the format so someone else could write a library
   for working with RIFF images. Sadly there is no commerical reason for Corel to
   do this. All it would do is make their software more useful; since usefulness is
   not what really sells software, there is no reason for them to do this.
</p>

<h2> Another solution that would have been lousy but better than nothing</h2>
<p>Corel could have made Painter scriptable.  On the Mac, ‘scriptable’
   means it exposes a dictionary of commands to AppleScript’s voodoo.
   Writing programs in AppleScript is  about the worst imaginable
   way to spend my time I can actually imagine doing;  AppleScript is one
   of the worst-designed programming languages I have ever tried to do
   actual work in.  I mean, I hate Visual Basic, but AppleScript is worse. 
</p>
<p>Despite this, if Corel <em>had</em> exposed <code>open file</code> and <code>save as</code> commands, I
   could probably have cobbled together a script that  did one coversion.
   From there you can plug in to Automater and folder actions to make it
   keep your GIFs up-to-date with respect to the master copies in RIFF
   format.  Automated workflow!  It would be great.  Too bad I can’t have
   it.
</p>
<p>What Corel’s software does expose is a command cryptically named
   <code>DoScript</code>.  What does it do?  I don’t know.  It takes a parameter that
   is a string.  A string of what?  Special Corel commands?  I have done
   some digging, and it appears that when you save what Painter calls a
   script to a file, it is in some sort of text format.  Perhaps these can
   be fed in to the <code>DoScript</code> command, but if so I have yet to make it
   work.  Maybe it is supposed to be a file name?  Who knows?  Nobody
   knows, that’s who.
</p>

<h2> Digression on the subject of file names in AppleScript</h2>
<p>I started writing this article after attempting to make an AppleScript
   program that opens a file in Corel Painter.  The following works
</p>
<pre><code>tell application "Finder"
    open file "Macintosh HD:Users:pdc:foo:bar:baz.riff"
end tell
</code></pre><p>Note the use of the obsolete ‘file path’ notation (using colons).  I can
   also make it work with the file name as a variable:
</p>
<pre><code>tell application "Finder"
    set file_name to "Macintosh HD:Users:pdc:foo:bar:baz.riff"
    open file file_name
end tell
</code></pre><p>Fine.  But what if I want to use a Unix file name rather than a Mac OS 9
   file path?  It turns out that if I type this in to a script:
</p>
<pre><code>tell application "Finder"
    open POSIX file "/Users/pdc/foo/bar/baz.riff"
end tell
</code></pre><p>then the AppleScript compiler <em>rewrites it as a file path!</em>  It replaces
   my code with
</p>
<pre><code>tell application "Finder"
    open file "Macintosh HD:Users:pdc:foo:bar:baz.riff"
end tell
</code></pre><p>That is seriously fucked up.  If I try using a variable to hold the file
   name, it fails: I get an error message
</p>
<blockquote><p>Finder got an error: Can’t get POSIX file "/Users/pdc/foo/bar/baz.riff"
</p>
</blockquote><p>So opening files via the Finder also seems to be out, unless I fancy learning
   enough about AppleScript’s crappy string manipulation expressions to convert my
   file names in to file paths myself.
</p>

<h2> The light at the end of the tunnel is an illusion caused by excessive blood pressure</h2>
<p>There is another emergency backup approach to scripting non-scriptable
   applications: <a href="http://www.apple.com/applescript/uiscripting/">GUI scripting</a>.  This is so great that Apple devote a
   couple of paragraphs to it on the web site.  The idea is that you can
   send events direct to the buttons and text fields of the application,
   driving it more or less as the user would.  Here is an example:
</p>
<pre><code>tell application "Corel Painter 8"
    activate
end tell

tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Corel Painter 8"
        tell menu 1 of menu bar item "File" of menu bar 1
            click menu item "Clone"
        end tell
    end tell
end tell
</code></pre><p>This clicks the File &rarr; Clone menu item, creating a flattened
   version of the frontmost image.  Since the user interface of Painter is
   undocumented, producing even the above script takes hours of fiddling
   with Apple’s GUI spy program and guessing what the names of this
   actually are (since it does not go so far as telling you).
</p>
<p>With a similar incantation I can make the Save As dialogue box appear.
   Now I want to change the file type from RIFF to GIF in the drop-down
   list.  Unfortunately its expression in AppleScript is
</p>
<pre><code>pop up button 1 of ??? of window "Open"
</code></pre><p>where the question marks need to be replaced with a name I cannot type: the GUI
   element that is a child of <code>window "Open"</code> and a parent of the <code>pop up button</code>
   is listed as ‘Unknown’, but <code>unknown</code> is an AppleScript keyword of some sort. In
   the end I could not find a way to make this work. After spotting something in
   one of Apple’s code samples, I came up with a different appoach:
</p>
<pre><code>repeat 14 times
    keystroke tab
end repeat
keystroke space
keystroke "g"
delay 1
keystroke return
</code></pre><p>The existence of the <code>keystroke</code> command I had to infer from one of the
   code samples on Apple’s page; it is not documented anywhere.
</p>
<p>These seven lines do the same work as the seven characters
</p>
<pre><code>, "GIF"
</code></pre><p>in my hypothetical Python program. 
</p>

<h2> String manipulation by drunken fairy trolls</h2>
<p>The expression
</p>
<pre><code>name[:-4] + ‘.gif’
</code></pre><p>replaces the file-name suffix.  This happens automatically when yoiu
   change file types in the Save As dialogue, but you do also need to strip
   off the words <code>Clone of</code> from the front of the name (added because you
   are saving a clone of the original image).  Here’s the AppleScript
   equivalent:
</p>
<pre><code>set the_file_name to value of text field 1
if the_file_name starts with "Clone of " then
    set the_file_name to text 10 thru (length of the_file_name) of the_file_name
end if
set the value of text field 1 to the_file_name
</code></pre><p>The <code>text ... thru ...</code> expression comes from the<br/><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/aplscptian/">O’Reilly AppleScript
book</a>.  I can’t think how someone is supposed to guess it.  The
   array-slicing notation used in Python is also something you have to
   learn, of course, but the difference is that, in Python, you will use it
   often, and for many different things, because slices apply to lists, and
   lists are used for listing things in Python, instead of haveing unique
   and special keywords to learn for every object in the system.
</p>

<h2> Now for the output directory</h2>
<p>The Python program uses 
</p>
<pre><code>os.path.join(outDir, ...)
</code></pre><p>to arrange that the GIF files are stored in a different directory from
   where they came from.   To set the directory the file will be saved to
   in the Save As dialogue, I ended up (after an eternity of hacking) with
   this monstrosity:
</p>
<pre><code>keystroke "/" using control down
delay 1

repeat with the_char in every character of the_dir_name
    keystroke the_char
end repeat
keystroke return
</code></pre><p>The first part invokes an obscure feature of Mac OS X file dialogues: Ctrl <code>/</code>
   shows a sheet that lets you enter the directory name using your keyboard. The
   sample code I nicked this idea from sets a text field to the directory name;
   Corel’s pop-up window unhelpfully is nameless, so I can’t work out how to get at
   its fields. So I resorted to feeding it the characters one at a time.
</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that ‘repeat with the_char in every character of
   the<em>dir</em>name’ is no more English-like than ‘for char in name’ would be. I hate
   the way every review of AppleScript manuals says something like
</p>
<blockquote><p>AppleScript is a scripting language that mimics the syntax of English. 
   As such, it’s extremely similar to how sentences are structured and, 
   as a result, is very intuitive and simple to use.
</p>
</blockquote><p>AppleScript is <em>not</em> intuitive. Its syntax mimics English in the same way a
   cargo cultist mimics an airport. The supposedly English-like syntax is more
   complex, and therefore <em>harder</em> to use, than almost any other programming
   language apart from Perl. 
</p>

<h2> Status</h2>
<p>So far I have managed to get Corel Painter to save a file as a GIF, once it is
   loaded.   The bit where I set the directiory name sort of works, but seems to be
   flakey; luckily I don’t need it if I don’t mind all my files going to the same
   directory.  I am still stuck when it comes to opening all the files in a
   directory.  Maybe I should look in to how Automater does its stuff; perhaps I
   can get it to take care of the file names for me...
