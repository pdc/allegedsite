<div></div><p class="first">We moved house last month, and it took NTL four weeks to reconnect our
   TV, phone, and broadband—counting from the date they agreed that the
   changeover would occur.  Including the ten days’ or more lead time we
   gave them, we were deprived of all three services for over a month.  We
   have yet to discover whether they are billing us for the services we did
   not get.
</p>
<p>There were two main problems, one major and one minor. The minor problem
   is that, since I was moving house rather than a new customer, I has to
   phone the special reduced-service House Move line, which has reduced
   hours (09:00-17:00 M-F) and very long queues, unless you call before
   about 10:00. 
</p>
<p>The major problem is that wiring up the new place is something that
   requires the physical presence of an installer, and NTL cannot schedule
   visits for toffee. In the second week of May we arranged the visit for
   the 21st. I stayed in all Saturday, but no installer arrived. When I
   phoned afterwards I was told that the install was marked as ‘complete’
   and that they would email the field office to get them to phone us to
   make a new appointment. They did not phone until Tuesday 31 May, and
   arranged a visit for 1 June and (after another no-show) 8 June.
   Eventually, after I called to say I had had no call from the field
   office (again) I got someone at NTL’s call centre on my side and an
   offer for a visit later that very day. I cycled home and poked about the
   kitchen for random scraps of food for lunch, and waited for the
   installers to arrive.
</p>
<p>Once they were there the installers did a fine job, running wires in all
   sorts of creative ways to allow us to have our TV upstairs and the cable
   modem in the opposite side of the house from the phone, and so on. So
   far as I can judge, they worked efficiently, did not dawdle or waste
   time, and took a little over two hours. During this time they at least
   twice recieved phone calls demanding they add another visit to their
   rounds today. These they ignored as obviously impossible: they already
   had two more ‘triples’ that day.  The impression I get is that the
   people scheduling visits have un unrealistic idea of how many installs
   can be done in a working day, and once they have to start juggling
   today’s scheduled visits with extra visits for irate customers who got
   missed last week and doubleplusurgent visits for people three weeks late
   the schedule all goes to pot. I idly wondered if all the analysis
   computer scientists have done with scheduling algorithms would help
   here.
</p>
<p>I also think there is a terrible lack of useful communication
   between the organizing centre of NTL and the people on the ground who
   actually do the work.  NTL’s database spent weeks claiming the job was
   done—I had to start each phone call explaining that the installer had
   not told me why the job was unfinished because I had never met him.  Now
   the job was done, it was I who had to persuade them that the visit had
   occurred, and I was calling them from the phone that had just been
   wired in...
</p>
<p>I could not get my broadband connection to work. When I phoned their
   broadband support line, it turned out the solution was to visit an
   obscure web site (she had to recite the IP dotted-quad over the phone)
   and enter the password assigned to us a year ago when we first got
   broadband. This wored fine, and the support person could not have been
   more polite and efficient in diagnosing the problem and correcting it.
   The only problem is that I should never have had to make the call in the
   first place! NTL <em>knew</em> I was moving house, their database knew my
   router’s MAC address and all that jazz, so why did I have to reregister
   at all? And if I did need to reregister, surely they could have <em>told</em>
   me I needed to and saved a call to their support lines? But, no, it
   seems their system for co-ordinating the change-over is to just wait for
   the customer to call technical support.
</p>
<p>In similar vein, I then spend several days phoning repeatedly to ask why
   we were not receiving any channels beyond BBC1, BBC2, ITV1 and C4; each
   time they said the billing system had not quite understood that we were
   installed now, and that they would try entering my box and card numbers
   again.  Finally I experimented with calling the fault line rather than
   customer service and lo! the TV started working almost as soon as I hung
   up.  I wonder if they have some system where customer-service employees
   can’t really make changes, whereas the fault-fixers have greater access
   to the bits of the database that were going wrong?  The fault line also
   has infinitely preferable on-hold music.
</p>
<p>Conclusions?  Well, most of my friends gave up long before we did, and
   have Sky + BT + DSL as their comms solution: in at least once case, a
   friend has switched from NTL because of their customer-service problems.
   We stuck with NTL partly because installing a satellite dish would be
   no fun, and, besides, we don’t want to give Murdoch any more money than
   absolutely necessary.  My advice to other people struggling with NTL
   would be:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     call very early (as soon after 09:00 as possible), especially during
     the student-go-home period of June;
 </li>

 <li>
     get a speaker phone or hands-free headset if possible to allow you
     to get some work done while on hold;
 </li>

 <li>
     a pocket-sized notebook with your account number, smart-card number, box number,
     and phone number etc. will allow you to phone NTL in random bits of free
     time and track which parts of the menu tree remain to be explored;
     and
 </li>

 <li>
     if you can figure out a way to construe your problem as a fault, you
     may get a better service from their fault line.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>A word of caution: the story is not quite over yet: NTL have not yet
   sent us a cheque for the &pound;110&middot;89 they overcharged us for
   the year before we moved, and neither have we seen any evidence as to
   whether they intend to charge us for the period we had no service.
