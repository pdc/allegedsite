      We first met <a
      href="http://www.bahala-na.co.uk/about.htm">David Goodman</a>
      and his minicomics when he and <a
      href="http://www.favouritecrayon.co.uk/">his brother Arthur</a>
      and some friends attended <a
      href="http://caption.org/2001/">CAPTION 2001</a>.  Now
      he&rsquo;s got his own web site, where he has published <a
      href="http://www.bahala-na.co.uk/comics/">most of his
      strips</a>, <a
      href="http://www.bahala-na.co.uk/gallery/">sketchbooks</a> and
      reviews of things like <a
      href="http://www.bahala-na.co.uk/articles/caption2k1.htm">CAPTION
      2001</a>.  He&rsquo;s also editor of an anthology zine <a
      href="http://www.bahala-na.co.uk/zipgun/"><cite>Zip Gun
      Presents</cite></a> and is soliciting submissions.
