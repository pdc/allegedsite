      <h1>About character encodings</h1>
      <p>
        Modern text-processing software is described in terms of Unicode
        (or, equivalently, ISO&nbsp;10646).  That is, operations are described
        in terms of <em>character data</em>, where characters are the code
        points defined in the Unicode universal character set.  Examples of
        Unicode code points include U+0041 <samp>A</samp> (latin capital
        letter A), U+00C1 <samp>&#x00C1;</samp> (latin capital letter A with
        acute), U+2014 &mdash; (em dash)
      </p>
      <p>
        These numbers must be <em>encoded</em> as sequences of bytes
        if they are to be stored in files on disc, or transmitted over
        networks, or passed as parameters to library functions.  The simplest
        encodings use one byte to represent one character; this obviously
        limits them to at most 256 Unicode code points.  Examples of
        single-byte encoding-schemes are ASCII, which encodes the first 128
        code points of Unicode one-for-one (code 0x41 encodes U+0041, and so
        on), and cannot encode characters beyond U+007F, and ISO 8859-1 (also
        called Latin-1), which encodes the first 256 code points of Unicode.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other single-byte encodings map bytes on to different Unicode
        characters&mdash;for example, ISO 8859-7 (Greek) maps characters in
        the range 0xC0 to 0xFF on to Greek letters (Unicode U+0370 onwards).
      </p>
      <h2>About English punctuation</h2>
      <p>
        In typeset books, quoted words and phrases may be distinguished
        from the rest of the text through a change of typeface (from upright
        to italic, for example), or through quotation marks.  In English the
        marks of quotation are the apostrophe <samp>&rsquo;</samp> (Unicode
        U+2019 RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK) and the inverted comma
        <samp>&lsquo;</samp> (Unicode U+2018 LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK).  In
        the days of hot-metal printing, the inverted (or turned) comma was
        literally a comma that was turned upside-down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that Unicode uses the name APOSTROPHE for U+0027
        <samp>'</samp>, a typewriter-inspired character that combines the
        roles of apostrophe, opening quotation mark, prime, and even acute
        accent.  It is often called <em>quote</em> or <em>tick</em> and is
        important in writing in computer languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The glyphs for these characters vary according to the operating
        system your fonts were designed for.  On many systems using the X11
        window system, and many terminals, the glyphs for U+0027 and U+0060
        look more appropriate for U+2018 and U+2019, reflecting the common
        convention of using the former as substitutes for the latter.
