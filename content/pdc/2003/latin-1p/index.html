      <h1>Latin-1p: Latin-1 with English punctuation</h1>
      <p>
        This is a character encoding designed to be useful for Unix
        systems and other ASCII-centric operating systems.  It addresses a
        widespread defect in computer operating systems whereby characters
        derived from ASCII (or one of the ISO 646 encodings) are given
        priority over those needed to write in the English language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note.  This document assumes your web browser (or whatever display
        software you are using) understands and can display Unicode
        punctuation characters.  For many browsers, such as Opera or Mozilla
        on Linux, this is not the case at the time of writing.  Please use
        your imagination...

      <h2>Do I need to use Latin-1p?</h2>
      <p>
        On windoes systems with recent HTML-writing software so-called
        &lsquo;smart quotes&rsquo; should work as they appear on the screen.
        <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/demoroniser/">Older versions get it wrong</a>
        because they label documents saved  using the
        Windows-1252 encoding as if they were in ISO-8859&ndash;1.
        This worked if documents prepared on Windows were only viewed on
        Windows systems using sloppily written browsers.
        Modern editions of Microsoft FrontPage
        encode quotation marks as numeric entities in HTML, which works well
        enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you use a text editor that does not have &lsquo;smart&rsquo;
        quotes then you are stuck entering the character codes (in
        Windows-1252, in decimal) on your numeric keypad, or else using
        Character Map.  In this case you may find that using the Latin-1p
        conventions is more convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Macintosh systems you can type English punctuation amrks
        directly (using the Option key).  Again old text editors and even old
        HTML editors blithely write the MacRoman character codes to the text
        files and then present them as if they were in ISO&nbsp;8859&ndash;1,
        with even more ugly results, since the MacRoman punctuation characters
        become accented letters on non-Macintosh systems.  Again, more modern
        software gets it right, and so Latin-1p may be irrelevant to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most Unix and Linux systems have patchy support for Unicode and
        Unicode encodings at best, and entering punctuation marks in to your
        favourite text editor may be simply impossible.  Latin-1p may be an
        attractive alternative to typing character entities for every mark of
        punctuation in a document.

          Markus Kuhn.  &lsquo;Summary: Please do not use the ASCII grave accent (0x60) as
          a left quotation mark together with the ASCII apostrophe (0x27) as
          the corresponding right quotation mark&rsquo;
          Apparently
          <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/apostrophe.html">it&rsquo;s even worse for people typing English on German keyboards</a>

          Patchy implementation of the <code>q</code> tag makes it useless,
