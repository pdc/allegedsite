<p class="first"><img src="../2006/bike_t.jpeg" alt="" align="right" width="100" height="75" border="0" />My previous bike having been stolen, and Trek having discontinued that
   model, I got a new black bike for my daily commute.    This was an
   unsual experience for me: not only did I have to order the bike
   specially, I also got to specify how it would be customized for my
   requirements.  I’ve now been riding it for a couple of weeks, and I’m
   really pleased with it.
</p>

<h2> Off the Peg?</h2>
<p>When I went to <a href="http://www.beelinebicycles.co.uk/" title="Broken website">Beeline Bicycles</a> I had one important criterion: 7-speed hub
   gears.  My old bike had a <a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/nexus-mech.html">Shimano Nexus 7</a>, which I prefer to a
   <a href="http://www.infovisual.info/05/035_en.html">derailleur</a> for several reasons (over and above the trouble <a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/derailer.html" title="Derailer, Not Derailleur!">I have
spelling it</a>): the gear ratios are more evenly spaced and suited to
   urban cycling, the chain cannot come off, it needs nearly no regular
   maintenence, and so on.<br/>
</p>
<p>Sadly, for reasons that must bewilder European visitors, hub-geared
   bikes are virtually unknown in British bike shops; instead people
   struggle about town in knobbly-tired mountain bikes with rusty gears and
   no mudgards, because somehow that’s more sporty.  Trek have discontinued
   their token hub model, so we looked through the catalogues in the shop
   for an alternative.
</p>

align="left" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>What we
   found  was the <a href="http://www.brixtoncycles.co.uk/commuter_crossroads.html#HU8" title="Description at Brixton Cycles">Specialized Crossroads Hu8</a> (more statistics
   at <a href="http://www.bikescene.co.uk/moreinfo.php?variation=638&sale=0">BikeScene</a>).   For &pound;399 you get an aluminium frame,
   V-brakes,  puncture-resistent wheels, a stylish black paint job, and an
   8-speed Nexus. Annoyingly, their stockist had none in my size of frame
   (XL), so I had to wait a few extra weeks for it to be ordered.
</p>

<h2> Customization</h2>
<p>The frame, brakes, and wheels are an upgrade relative to the Trek 745T,
   but the Crossroads is missing mudguards and rear rack, so I had to order
   those at the same time. I also ordered a lock.
</p>
<div>
    <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pdc/132830809/" title="Hub Dynamo on Flickr"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/53/132830809_d658148f83_m.jpg" width="240" height="180"
align="right" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>While I was at it, I also specified something
   I’d been toying with for my old bike before it was stolen: a hub dynamo.
   Because I was ordering at the same time as the bike itself, the shop
   were willing to buy back the front wheel that would be displaced by the
   new wheel with dynamo hub, which saves me a little cash.  The lights come
   with a ‘standlight’ feature: they contain a capaciter that charges as
   the wheels turn, which they use to stay lit when stopping at junctions. 
   This eliminates  one of the old disadvantages of dynamo lights, that you
   vanish when you stop.
</p>
<p>By the time I’d specified all this, I had spent an hour or so in the
   shop talking bikes, something I don’t get to do very often.  It is also
   rather unusual for me to order something built to my specifications.  It
   made me feel rather grand.
</p>

<h2> Riding It</h2>
<p>Finally the thing arrived, and after a week or so in the shop, they had finished
   setting up the dynamo and other mods.  I have now been commuting on it for a
   couple of weeks, and I am really pleased with it.
</p>

<p>Compared to my old bike, it is lighter and slightly taller. There are other
   differences that won’t surprise someone who has bought a bike more recently than
   five years ago: the handle-bar grips are oval and soft and grippy instead of
   being hard cyclinders of plastic; the saddle has a furrow to spare my perineum
   (and collect rainwater); the pedals are neater and a little more cleverly
   engineered, and so on. Gear changes work through two thumb-operated buttons,
   rather than the twist-shift I was used to. The new gears feel faster: I can
   easily turn the top gear on the long, downward, straight part of my morning
   commute, but it would mean going faster than I feel is safe when there are bus
   stops and pedestrian crossings to consider. There is a general temptation to
   ride faster.
</p>
<p>Having dynamo lights is great fun. When I get home I get of the bike, lock it,
   and then go to unclip the lights and remember I don’t have to any more. It is
   rather odd at first, walking off and leaving the bike locked up with the lights
   glowing, thanks to the built-in capaciters. The front light is bright enough to
   cast light on to the road and walls ahead of me. So far as I can tell, the rear
   light is pretty bright too. And unlike battery lights, I do not expect them to
   be a bit dim half the time.<br/>

<p>Even <a href="http://www.abus.de/us/main.asp?ScreenLang=us&sid=80282229216183822042006622541286&select=0104b01&ArtikelGrID=1" title="ABUS, the good feeling of security">the lock</a> is pleasingly designed.  Apart from using a flat key rather than
   the notoriously pickable round locks of yesteryear, the way it clips to the
   bike when not is use is clever: the shackle fits in to a cup attached to the
   frame of my bike, and the <em>U</em> locks in to place through a hole in the side of
   the cup, holding the lock rock-steady.<br/>
</p>
<p>After a month spent walking 45 minutes to and from work each day, I am very
   pleased with my new commuting machine.  I can’t wait for the <a href="http://www.thisisoxfordshire.co.uk/display.var.706590.0.0.php" title="Towpath will be closed for repairs (thisisoxfordshire.co.uk, 2006-03-15)">towpath
repairs</a> to be complete so I can switch to cycling to work along the river!
