      Pilgrim&rsquo;s distress</a> at the excision of
      <code>cite</code> from <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xhtml2-20021211/mod-text.html#s_textmodule">XHTML
      2.0&rsquo;s Text module</a>.  The irony is that
      <code>cite</code> is one of the &lsquo;semantic&rsquo; tags
      (&lsquo;logical&rsquo; tags, as they used to be called) that is
      actually used and supported by web browsers.  Meanwhile fossils
      like <code>dfn</code>, <code>kbd</code> and <code>samp</code>
      are retained.
    </p>
    <p>
      In proper English-language typography, italics are used for
      various purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Citing things like movies and books (<cite>The Fellowship  the
        Rings</cite>, <cite>2001: A Space Odyssey</cite>), but not,
        for example, short stories (&lsquo;The Sentinel&rsquo;);
      </li>
      <li>
        Names of ships (<cite>HMS Beagle</cite>, <cite>HMS
        Endeavour</cite>), but not, for example, pubs (The Beagle and Hounds);
      </li>
      <li>
        Foreign tags (<i>ad nauseam</i>,
        <i>b&eacute;te noire</i>), but not when they have become
        English words in their own right (caf&eacute;,
        &aring;ngstr&ouml;m);
      </li>
      <li>
        Words and letters mentioned rather than used (&lsquo;the word
        <em>complex</em> is often confused with
        <em>complicated</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;mind your <em>p</em>s and
        <em>q</em>s&rsquo;);
      </li>
      <li>
        Terms being introduced for the first time* (&lsquo;we use
        <dfn>equivalence relation</dfn> to mean a relation that is
        symmetric, transitive, and associative...&rsquo;);
      </li>
      <li>
        Words and letters used as identifiers in mathematical
        work&dagger; (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, <var>&alpha;</var>,
        <var>&beta;</var>), with special exceptions for some standard
        functions like sin and cos;
      </li>
      <li>
        Ditto for writings about computing by authors who think of
        computing as being related to maths
        (<var>gcd</var>(<var>a</var>,&nbsp;<var>b</var>),
        <var>shortest_path</var>, <var>CLUNK</var>); and
      </li>
      <li>
        To indicate <em>emphasis</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The implication of the XHTML&nbsp;2 draft is that all of the
      above actual, real-people uses of mark-up only deserve a single
      tag, <code>em</code>.  If we want to have a single element whose
      semantic, logical, Platonic ur-meaning is &lsquo;text that is
      printed in italics&rsquo;, why not just use <code>i</code> and
      save us some typing?
    </p>

    <p>
      Meanwhile there are separate XHTML tags for several esoteric
      usages that exist <em>only</em> in computer literature, and in
      fact only in computer manuals: <code>code</code>,
      <code>samp</code>, <code>kbd</code>, and (in some
      interpretations) <code>var</code>.  Now, even computer-literate
      types are inconsistent in their use of a special typeface to
      distinguish &lsquo;computer text&rsquo; from other text.  For
      identifiers in programs one might argue that italics works
      nicely and is easier to read (<a
      href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/homepage.html">Bjarne
      Stroustrup</a> uses italics rather than typewriter in the third
      edition of <a
      href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/3rd.html"><cite>The C++
      Programming Language</cite></a>).  Few, if any, find the time to
      distinguish between typing <kbd>foo</kbd> on the keyboard, the
      character sequence <samp>foo</samp> it generates, the program
      fragment <code>foo</code> and the variable <var>foo</var> it is
      parsed as.  And if you are in that position, you probably ought
      to be using DocBook instead...
    </p>

    <p>
      I&rsquo;d wager that even back in the dawn of the <abbr
      title="World-Wide Web">WWW</abbr>, non-computer-related text
      dominated the Web, starting with those particle-physics
      databases and the <a href="http://imdb.com/uk/">IMDB</a>.  The
      HTML features designed to support computer manuals are a fossil,
      left over from when the HTML vocabulary was lifted from <a
      href="http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/texinfo.html"><abbr
      title="Gnu&rsquo;s not Unix">GNU</abbr>
      Texinfo</a> (or something closely related thereto).
    </p>

    <h2>Idle speculation</h2>

    <p>
      There are precedents for formatting that which is normally
      italicized differently.  The Texinfo conventions for
      <code>cite</code>, <code>em</code>, and <code>var</code> are
      <code>_cite_</code>, <code>*em*</code>, and <code>VAR</code>.
      Donald E. Knuth in the <cite>TeXBook</cite> distinguishes
      citation from emphasis, using oblique type for the former and
      true italic for the latter (the mad fool).
    </p>

    <p>
      For what it is worth, if I&nbsp;were king of XHTML for a day
      I&nbsp;would retain <code>cite</code>.  Would it also be
      appropriate to extend it to other names of things like ship
      names?  Many of the above uses of italics are really a form of
      quotation; they could use <code>q</code>, which after all has
      never been very successful at supplying quotation marks:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        Strunk abhored the phrase &lt;q&gt;student body&lt;/q&gt; and suggested
        &lt;q&gt;studentry&lt;/q&gt; instead.
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>producing something like</p>

    <blockquote>
        Strunk abhored the phrase <i>student body</i> and suggested
        <i>studentry</i> instead.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In print this would be set with italics, but you can see how it
      could just as easily have used quotation marks.  (In principle
      the use of typewriter text for computery stuff is also a form of
      quotation and could arguably be a variation on <code>q</code>!)
    </p>

    <p>
      Actual reported speech and would use actual marks of quotation,
      which in British tradition are <code>&amp;lsquo;</code> and
      <code>&amp;rsquo;</code> (&lsquo;&hellip;&rsquo;), and in
      American <code>&amp;ldquo;</code> and <code>&amp;rdquo;</code>
      (&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;).
    </p>

    <p>
      This leaves <code>dfn</code> for definitions, <code>var</code>
      for variables names and similar (metasyntactic variables, formal
      parameter names, and mathematical symbols).  Oh, and
      <code>em</code> to indicate emphasis <em>only</em>.  Hmm.  This
      almost makes sense.
    </p>


    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;am sticking with XHTML&nbsp;1.0 for now.  To
      be honest I&nbsp;am still chary of this new-fangled
      <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> media-type (I still
      haven&rsquo;t found out why they want
      <code>application</code> rather than <code>text</code>).
      I&nbsp;think that even if XHTML&nbsp;2 is not intended to be
      backward-compatible with XHTML&nbsp;1, it nevertheless should be
      rich enough that documents may be converted between formats
      without loss of information.  Folding <code>cite</code> in to
      <code>em</code> on the face of it violates that principle.
    </p>
    

    <h2>Footnotes</h2>

    <p>
      * The element <code>dfn</code> was lifted from Texinfo to cover
      this case, but was not supported by browsers (it was not shown
      italicized), so no-one uses it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &dagger; The element <code>var</code> was originally introduced
      to cover the mathematical and metasyntactic use (being lifted
      straight out of the Texinfo conventions), but Microsoft Internet
      Explorer&rsquo;s designers got it wrong and used the monospace
      font for <code>var</code>, in effect changing its meaning.  The
      XHTML&nbsp;2 description tends towards the latter
      interpretation.
