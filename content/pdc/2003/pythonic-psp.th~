      <a href="http://www.jasc.com/pbeta/psp/">Paint Shop Pro 8</a> (a
      Windows paint program) is out in beta and uses <a
      href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> as its scripting
      engine.  It also has new distortion and fancy brush features.
      (Found on <a
      href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0102677/2003/02/17.html#a41">Kevin
      Altis&rsquo; Radio Weblog</a> via <a
      href="http://www.deadlybloodyserious.com/Python/">Garth
      T.&nbsp;Kidd</a>.)

    <p>
      Having a Python scripting engine is interesting in two ways.
      First, it will help people who have to do complex, repetative
      work with lots of images in a day&mdash;as part of a web
      publishing or video game development pipeline.  Second, it could
      enable an aftermarket in plug-ins for fancy graphics effects
      (and it will be easier to write them in Python than it would be
      with some C++ plug-in interface).
    </p>
    <p>
      This might be useful at work&mdash;I&nbsp;use PSP&nbsp;7 for
      what little graphics work is required&mdash;and perhaps evan at
      home (I&nbsp;sometimes use PSP on Jeremy&rsquo;s NT box).
      I&nbsp;already use Python and Tcl scripting with graphics files
      as part of this web site (for example, the photo albums), but a
      scriptable paint program would have a larger repertoire of
      graphic effects.  Could be interesting.
