Title: NTL do not understand the concept of moving house

We moved house last month, and it took NTL four weeks to reconnect our
TV, phone, and broadband--counting from the date they agreed that the
changeover would occur.  Including the ten days' or more lead time we
gave them, we were deprived of all three services for over a month.  We
have yet to discover whether they are billing us for the services we did
not get.

There were two main problems, one major and one minor. The minor problem
is that, since I was moving house rather than a new customer, I has to
phone the special reduced-service House Move line, which has reduced
hours (09:00-17:00 M-F) and very long queues, unless you call before
about 10:00. 

The major problem is that wiring up the new place is something that
requires the physical presence of an installer, and NTL cannot schedule
visits for toffee. In the second week of May we arranged the visit for
the 21st. I stayed in all Saturday, but no installer arrived. When I
phoned afterwards I was told that the install was marked as 'complete'
and that they would email the field office to get them to phone us to
make a new appointment. They did not phone until Tuesday 31 May, and
arranged a visit for 1 June and (after another no-show) 8 June.
Eventually, after I called to say I had had no call from the field
office (again) I got someone at NTL's call centre on my side and an
offer for a visit later that very day. I cycled home and poked about the
kitchen for random scraps of food for lunch, and waited for the
installers to arrive.

Once they were there the installers did a fine job, running wires in all
sorts of creative ways to allow us to have our TV upstairs and the cable
modem in the opposite side of the house from the phone, and so on. So
far as I can judge, they worked efficiently, did not dawdle or waste
time, and took a little over two hours. During this time they at least
twice recieved phone calls demanding they add another visit to their
rounds today. These they ignored as obviously impossible: they already
had two more 'triples' that day.  The impression I get is that the
people scheduling visits have un unrealistic idea of how many installs
can be done in a working day, and once they have to start juggling
today's scheduled visits with extra visits for irate customers who got
missed last week and doubleplusurgent visits for people three weeks late
the schedule all goes to pot. I idly wondered if all the analysis
computer scientists have done with scheduling algorithms would help
here.

I also think there is a terrible lack of useful communication
between the organizing centre of NTL and the people on the ground who
actually do the work.  NTL's database spent weeks claiming the job was
done--I had to start each phone call explaining that the installer had
not told me why the job was unfinished because I had never met him.  Now
the job was done, it was I who had to persuade them that the visit had
occurred, and I was calling them from the phone that had just been
wired in...

I could not get my broadband connection to work. When I phoned their
broadband support line, it turned out the solution was to visit an
obscure web site (she had to recite the IP dotted-quad over the phone)
and enter the password assigned to us a year ago when we first got
broadband. This wored fine, and the support person could not have been
more polite and efficient in diagnosing the problem and correcting it.
The only problem is that I should never have had to make the call in the
first place! NTL *knew* I was moving house, their database knew my
router's MAC address and all that jazz, so why did I have to reregister
at all? And if I did need to reregister, surely they could have *told*
me I needed to and saved a call to their support lines? But, no, it
seems their system for co-ordinating the change-over is to just wait for
the customer to call technical support.

In similar vein, I then spend several days phoning repeatedly to ask why
we were not receiving any channels beyond BBC1, BBC2, ITV1 and C4; each
time they said the billing system had not quite understood that we were
installed now, and that they would try entering my box and card numbers
again.  Finally I experimented with calling the fault line rather than
customer service and lo! the TV started working almost as soon as I hung
up.  I wonder if they have some system where customer-service employees
can't really make changes, whereas the fault-fixers have greater access
to the bits of the database that were going wrong?  The fault line also
has infinitely preferable on-hold music.

Conclusions?  Well, most of my friends gave up long before we did, and
have Sky + BT + DSL as their comms solution: in at least once case, a
friend has switched from NTL because of their customer-service problems.
We stuck with NTL partly because installing a satellite dish would be
no fun, and, besides, we don't want to give Murdoch any more money than
absolutely necessary.  My advice to other people struggling with NTL
would be:

  * call very early (as soon after 09:00 as possible), especially during
    the student-go-home period of June;
  * get a speaker phone or hands-free headset if possible to allow you
    to get some work done while on hold;
  * a pocket-sized notebook with your account number, smart-card number, box number,
    and phone number etc. will allow you to phone NTL in random bits of free
    time and track which parts of the menu tree remain to be explored;
    and
  * if you can figure out a way to construe your problem as a fault, you
    may get a better service from their fault line.

A word of caution: the story is not quite over yet: NTL have not yet
sent us a cheque for the &pound;110&middot;89 they overcharged us for
the year before we moved, and neither have we seen any evidence as to
whether they intend to charge us for the period we had no service.
