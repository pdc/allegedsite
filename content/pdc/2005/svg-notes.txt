I am pretty sure that surrounding an embedded SVG image with an HTML
anchor will not work on browsers that display SVG via a plug-in (e.g.,
MSIE with Adobe SVG Viewer).      

I think there is a pholosophical problem here.  There are two ways
images are embedded in an HTML document: `img` produces an inert image,
so click events are handled by a surrounding `a` element, whereas
`embed` produce active images that handle mouse-click events
themselves.  The question is, is `object` like `img` or is `object`
like `embed`?       

Perhaps we can generalize the idea of embedding so that events bubble
out of the embedded document (if the embedded document can handle mouse
events in teh first place).  Then an SVG image that has its own links
and `onclick` handlers will capture the events first, whereas an SVG
image that happens not to capture events lets them escape to its
container.  I don't know enough of how the frame abstractions work
internally to know if this is easy or hard to fit in to how Mozilla works.       

I recently upgraded to Mac Os X 10.4, and Safari 2 does not
automatically use the ASV plug-in already installed. I’ve tried to
reinstall it but Stuffit Expander is no longer bundled with Mac OS, so
it can’t open the file! Argh!

As a completely irrelevant asided, reading some of the above comments,
I wonder if Mozilla developers are aware that SVG is a format for
expressing 2d graphics, and not merely a way to demonstrate the
cleverness of Mozilla’s XML infrastructure!     


My prediction for the future is that within, say, fifty years or so,
people will expect to be able to use arbitrary-resolution displays
with scalable graphics, much as researchers did *twenty* *years*
*ago* with Display PostScript and NeWS.  At this point people will
either be using SVG, and XML will still be a big thing, or else they
will be using Adobemedia PDFFlash and XML will be an obscure format
used by database junkies.        

**Update (2005-12-10).** You can't wrap an embedded SVG image in an
HTML `a` tag (bug [294932][]). and you can't put event handlers on the SVG `a`
tag (bug [267664][]
