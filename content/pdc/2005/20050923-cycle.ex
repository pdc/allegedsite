Thursday 22 September is [International Car-Free Day][22], the highlight of [Europenan
Mobility Week][1]--but if you live in Oxford you may not have noticed..

I read that Car-Free Day is celebrted in European citites by closing
part of the town center to cars and running all sorts of events in the
car-free streets. The idea is to show people some of the alternatives to
simply surrendering all streets to motor traffic. [In Oxford][3] we
feebly closed a street *that was already closed to through traffic* and
had a couple of stalls from the usual volunteer groups.

The upshot of this was that my experience of Car-Free Day was coming to
a halt on my normal route in to work 
and being obliged to get off my
bike and walk through the closed half of Broad Street.  Worse than that,
the first thing I saw out of the ordinary was signs informing me that
disabled parking had been suspended in the affected section of street.
It seems that the only people more worthless than cyclists to the
city planners are wheelchair users.

I could not really afford to linger to talk to the people there--I was,
after all, on my way to work--but I did grab a leaflet from the [Oxford  City
Council][4]'s [Air-Quality Action Plan][5], which mentions that Queen's
Street needs a 90 per cent. reduction in oxides of nitrogen, which is
another way of saying that lebels are ten times the safety limit.

Oxford has a traffic-congenstion problem, caused largely by the
short-sightedness of medieval town planners, who failed to anticipate
the need for 38-tonne lorries and so built a beautiful city designed to
be appreciated on a human scale.  These days we need a bomb scare in a
department store to see the college buildings at their best: from the
middle of the street, on foot.

The unregulated swamping of our city streets with motor-cars has not
only made the old lanes dangerous, noisy, and smelly, but has
damaged the very buildings themselves. The colleges were built from a
pleasant yellow stone that sadly turned out to be very vulnerable to the
weak acid rain caused by exhaust fumes: during the twentieth century,
walls that had stood for hundreds of years turned black and started to
rot. During the 1990s there was a huge effort to clean, repair, and
replace the colleges' walls and gargoyles, and to cover them with new
preservatives.

Oxford also has a tradition of people getting about by bicycle.  You
might think that town and county councils, who claim to be concerned by
the problems of congestion, would encourage cycling.  They have
nevertheless acted entirely consistently with a policy of trying to
drive cyclists out of the city and give it over utterly to the drivers
of lorries and SUVs.  The occasional cycle symbol painted apparently at
random looks more like a sop to the national government's alleged
pro-cycling policies.  Or perhaps there are one or two cycling
enthusiasts amongst the Land-Rover-driving majority on the councils.
