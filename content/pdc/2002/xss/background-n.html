      <h1>RSS vs. RSS</h1>
      <p>
        One of the strange things about  the weblogging world is that there are
        <em>two</em> <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/"><abbr title="Extensible Mark-up Language">XML</abbr></a> formats with the same initials:
        <a href="http://backend.userland.com/rss092">Really Simple Syndication</a>, and
        <a href="http://www.purl.org/rss/1.0/">RDF Site Summary</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both ultimately derive from a format from
        Netscape called
        <a href="http://my.netscape.com/publish/formats/rss-0.9.dtd">RDF Site Summary 0.9</a>

(although it was not technically
        <abbr title="Resource-Description Framework">RDF</abbr>-compatible).

The first revision 0.91
        is not backwards compatible, in the sense
        that an RSS-0.9 document
        isn&rsquo;t an RSS-0.91 document:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The 0.91 root element is
          <code>rss</code> rather than <code>rdf:RDF</code>
          (abandonning the pretence of <abbr title="Resource-Description Framework">RDF</abbr> compatbility).
        </li>
        <li>
          In 0.91, the
          channel&rsquo;s <code>item</code> elements are nested inside the
          <code>channel</code> element (rather than following it).
        </li>
        <li>In 0.9 the elements are in the namespace <code>http://my.netscape.com/rdf/simple/0.9/</code>.  In 0.91 the elements have no namespace.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many elements were added based on the

<a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML">Scripting News</a>

format, adding per-item metadata beyond the bare headline and <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 0.9x series continues with <abbr title="RSS">RSS</abbr> 0.92 and <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> 2.0, which
        are upwards-compatible (0.91 documents are 0.92 documents, etc.).
        <abbr title="RSS">RSS</abbr> 0.92 is the format with the largest number of feeds
        on the syndic8 web site (as of September 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
        <abbr title="RDF Site Summary">RSS</abbr> 1.0 is the product of the RSS-DEV mailing list.
        It is a successor to <abbr title="RDF Site Summary">RSS</abbr> 0.9 (retaining the <code>rdf:RDF</code>
        root element and the positioning of <code>item</code>s following the
        <code>channel</code>), which has had additions made to make it valid <abbr title="Resource-Description Framework">RDF</abbr>,
        and a system of extension through modules.
        It is <em>not</em> a successor to 0.91 or 0.92
        (with their <code>rss</code> root element etc.), although most of the
        elements added in 0.92 are also incorporated in 1.0.  Neither is it
        <em>technically</em> upward-compatible with 0.9 (the XML
        namespace used is different, etc.).
        Not that this matters much, since 0.9 is no longer deployed.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/09/06.html#history_of_the_rss_fork">some discussion at the time</a> as to whether the

1.0 format should have a different name.
        In the end the drivers of both formats each stuck with the initials RSS.
        Luckily there is a slight tendency to use different file-name extensions
        (<abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> 0.9x tends to use <code>.xml</code> or <code>.rss</code>,
        whereas <abbr title="RDF Site Summary">RSS</abbr> 1.0 tends to use <code>.rdf</code>).
