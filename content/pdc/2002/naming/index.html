      <h1>Suggestions for names in programs</h1>
      <p>
        Names used in programs should be consistent enough that one programmer
        can guess what the names used by another will probably be,
        and to reduce the mnemonic burden of keeping track of the
        many names.
        For example, it annoys me to have to remember to write
      </p>
      <pre>
WHERE DocRepMap.repId = Repositories.repositoryId</pre>
      <p>and not</p>
      <pre>
WHERE DocRepMap.repId = Reps.repId</pre>
      <p>
        or the other possible combinations.  I also find compound names
        like <code>User.userName</code> annoying&mdash;why not just have
        <code>User.name</code>?
      </p>
      <h2>Abbreviations</h2>
      <p>Programs are full of nouns used as class names and variable names.</p>
      <p>For any given noun, there should be at most three spellings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full form: programme, module, repository, iterator, index</li>
        <li>Short form: prog, mod, rep, iter, i</li>
        <li>One or two letters: p, m, r, it, i</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We can divide the categories of things being named according to
        longevity and how widely references are scattered throughout the
        programme.  Exactly what goes in which category depends on the
        programming language in question.  For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>classes, global functions (these are used widely and last a long time)</li>
        <li>member functions</li>
        <li>member variables</li>
        <li>local variables  (these are short-lived)</li>
        <li>loop counters   (these are even more short-lived)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The rules are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Things higher in this categorization should have longer (or equal length) names</li>
        <li>Things at the same level must use the same abbreviation for the same word</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        For example, if you have a member function <code>programme</code>, then
        the class name must be <code>Programme</code> not <code>Prog</code>, since class
        names are in a higher category.  My preference is to use the 1-letter
        forms for loop variables, the abbreviated form for locals and for
        member variables, and the full forms for member functions and class
        names.  For example:
      </p>
      <pre>
class Programme:
    ...
    def modules(self):
        if not self.mods:
            mods = []
            for m in db.allModules():
                if m.programme == self:
                    mods.append(m)
            self.mods = mods 
        return self.mods</pre>
      <p>(This is a lousy way to interrogate a database, but illustrates different spellings of the words <em>module</em>.)</p>
      <p>
        In many cases the short form and the full name are identical.  In
        some cases it makes sense for the 1-letter form and the short form to
        be the same.  There is a school of thought that rejects all
        abbreviations:
      </p>
      <pre>
class Programme:
    ...
    def modules(self):
        if not self.cachedModules:
            modules = []
            for module_ in db.allModules():
                if module_.programme == self:
                    modules.append(module_)
            self.cachedModules = modules 
        return self.cachedModules</pre>
      <p>
        (The trailing underscore is required to avoid a clash with a keyword.)
        This still obeys the above rules, of course, and saves one from having
        to decide which spelling to use.  On the other hand, I prefer
        to use shorter names as a hint that something is a temporary.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second rule tells us that if we abbreviate
        <em>expression</em> as <code>expr</code> in one place, we should stick
        with that spelling, and not switch randomly between
        <code>exp</code> and <code>expr</code>.   Note that XML abbreviates
        <em>attribute</em> as <code>ATT</code> in <code>ATTLIST</code>,
        thereby inconveniencing the hoards of programmers used to spelling it
        <code>attr</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        These rules apply within one domain.  When combining libraries or
        protocols from different domains, we come in to positions where the
        same word means different things and is conventionally abbreviated
        differently.  There&rsquo;s not much we can do about this except to
        try to keep consitent within domains.
      </p>
      <h2>Collections</h2>
      <p>By collection I mean all the various data structures that contain lots of objects&mdash;lists, sets, bags, arrays, vectors, dictionaries, tables, etc.  Collections should always have plural names:</p>
      <pre>
mod = mods[i] # Python
Dim mod_ As Module_ = mods(i) ' VB .Net
Module mod = mods[i]; // C++ and its parodies</pre>
      <p>
        When I&nbsp;was a lad, functional programmers conventionally
        used <code>x</code> to an object of arbitrary type,
        <code>xs</code> for a list of whatever <code>x</code> was,
        <code>xss</code> for a list of <code>xs</code>, and so on.
        This makes sense when using the single-letter abbreviations of names.
        Thus
      </p>
      <pre>
ps = [m.Programme for m in mods] # list of programmes
tss = [m.Topics for m in mods] # list of list of topics</pre>
      <p>
        When naming the types of collections (in languiages with explicit
        typing, like Java),
