  <h>How to make minicomics (caption.org)</h>
  <body>
    <p>
      I have added a couple of pages about <a
      href="http://caption.org/2002/minicomics/">how to draw
      minicomics</a> to the <a href="http://caption.org/2002/">CAPTION
      2002</a> web site.  Not a very profound bit of writing, but I
      hope some people will find it useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is also now a proper biog page for <a title="Jeremy
      Dennis" href="../../jrd/">Jeremy&rsquo;s section</a>
      of this site, complete with some new pictures.
      There are still some links left to the old site,
      but we&rsquo;re working on it...
