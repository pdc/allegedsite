      My back-burner project for the <a
      href="http://caption.org/">CAPTION</a> web site is something
      that I&nbsp;shall give the working name of Picky Picky Game.
      This game will work in <em>rounds</em>, with everyone able to vote for
      a picture from this round at the same time as people are
      submitting pictures for the next round.
      The idea is that we make a comic strip out of
      the favourite pictures from each round.
    </p>

    <p>
      A round might last a week or a month (depending on how often
      people submit new pictures), so I&nbsp;want to make it a
      configuration parameter.  The code I&nbsp;was working on today
      was the routine that works out the current round number, given
      today’s date, the start date, and the period.  For example,
      if we had 2-week rounds and had started on 1 January 2002, then
      we would today (2002-10-31) be in Round&nbsp;21.

      An information system for one’s mobile phone.  A lousy
      user interface, partly necessitated by the small form factor.
      And every second counts, because it is charged by time, not a
      per-byte or flat-rate fee.
      Therefore, obviously, WAP is only useful for information
      I&nbsp;really need, and which I&nbsp;need right now, 
      and for which I&nbsp;cannot simply go home and use my usual
      internet connection.  Such as, to pick a topic at random, train times.
    </p>

    <p>
      So it was I&nbsp;found myself in <a
      href="http://www.fweb.org.uk/dean/towns/lydney.htm">Lydney</a>
      yesterday (Sunday).  Lydney might or might not be a lovely
      village, but from the train station all you see is a few
      house-backs, a bus graveyard, a rusty wrecked car, and two
      doorless brick shelters.  The paper timetable listed no trains
      for over three hours.  We&nbsp;wanted confirmation before
      wandering off to look for a pub.  The Railway Enquiries number
      (0845 748 4950) was busy.  In desperation I&nbsp;thought
      I’d see if WAP could manage the job.  My <a
      href="http://www.virgin.com/mobile/">Virgin phone</a> has
      <em>two</em> links marked Travel.  Both lead to adverts for
      special offers and no actual information.  In the end, after
      twenty minutes of wandering through the menu structure and
      gritting my teeth at tiny progress indicators, I&nbsp;found
      Google.  Google found several train timetables, including one
      Dutch one, and (amazingly) a 500 error page or two.  One of them
      worked.  Praise Google!
    </p>

    <p>
      WAP does have a link to <a
      href="http://www.pocketbeer.com/">PocketBeer.com</a>, which
      located the nearest pub—in another village&ndash;but when
      I&nbsp;tried to follow a link to a page with the pub’s
      address, I&nbsp;got a 500 again.  Argh.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was very cold and windy, and Jeremy and I&nbsp;were still
      dressed in the clothes we wore to her sister Ell&euml;’s
      wedding, not to mention clutching a bouquet of very exotic
      flowers.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the end it was the much-overlooked press-button information
      point that supplied the most authoratative and useful
      confirmation of the train times.  It also warned us that,
      because of severe weather, train times were liable to change.
      By happy chance, someone else pressed the button for the other
      platform, which alerted us to a train we had overlooked in the
      opposite direction, which was much earlier than the one we were
      interminably waiting for.  It would at least take us to a
      station in an actual city, with the prospect of food, hot
      drinks, and maybe even a warm room to wait in.  So we worked out
      an alternative route.  Pressing the button again, we discovered
      the message had changed—the robot apologised profusely for
      cancelling the train we had just decided not to catch.  We were
      aware of some fallen trees on the way to the station, but this
      was this was the first indication of just how badly the train
      system was affected.
    </p>

    <p>
      WAP, despite being accessed via a device that knows my location
      to within a hundred metres, is incapable of delivering such
      locally specific information.  (Even the pub guide requires that
      I&nbsp;enter the name of the town using the keypad.)
    </p>

    <p>
      0845 748 4950 is similarly useless: you can press 1&nbsp;to
      enquire about the weather, but it is organized not
      geographically, but according to the companies that run the
      services.  Useless, in fact.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In the end the journey home, which took 3&nbsp;hours total on
      Saturday, took twelve full hours (Taxi from the hotel at 11:30,
      bus from the Oxford train station arriving 23:30).  The
      Lydney&ndash;Goucester leg was the most dramatic, actually
      having to stop at an apple orchard because the wreck of one of
      the trees had fallen over the line.  I&nbsp;have never been so
      pleased to see Didcot Parkway train station.

      rejects HLink, not many dead</a>
      scream the headlines.  Is this the end for XHTML&nbsp;2?
    </p>
    <p>
      What’s XHTML&nbsp;2?  It is the next step in the bridge
      from <abbr title="Hypertext Mark-up
      Language">HTML</abbr>&nbsp;4.01 to the futuristic world of
      ‘pure’ XML documents.  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xlink-20010627/">XLink</a> is a recommendation
      from the W3C for how XML documents should express links to other
      resources.  HLink is a new proposal from the XHTML committee for how
      XML documents should express links to other resources.  In
      effect, they are saying  that XLink is inadequate and they need
      to replace it.  <abbr title="Technical Architecture
      Group">TAG</abbr>
      <a
      href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Sep/0183.html">have
      expressed an opinion that XLink should be used instead</a>,
      presumably on the grounds that we don’t want to have
      <em>two</em> W3C recommendations for one and the same thing.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Can XLink replace the special-purpose linking attributes in
      HTML?  I&nbsp;suppose we can imagine replacing <code>img</code>
      and <code>object</code>
      tags with something like
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;object
    xlink:type="simple"
    xlink:show="embed"
    xlink:actuate="onLoad"
    xlink:href=&quot;myLogo.gif"
    width="400" height="300"&gt;
  My Logo
&lt;/object&gt;</pre>

    <p>
      In principal the first three attributes (which would be the same
      for all images) can be given default values in the <abbr title="Document-Type Definition">DTD</abbr>.  This is
      the approach used in <abbr title="Scalar Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>
      and <abbr title="Meths Mark-up Language">MathML</abbr>.
       The problem is that it
      prevents the XML document in question from being stand-alone.
      That is, the <abbr title="Document-Type Definition">DTD</abbr> must be downloaded and parsed before the
      document can be rendered.  <abbr title="Scalar Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> fudges this; <abbr title="Scalar Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> documents often do
      not have <code>DOCTYPE</code>s, and <abbr title="Scalar Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> viewers 
      in effect use a <abbr title="Document-Type Definition">DTD</abbr> compiled in to the software.  All very messy.  
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s another problem: the HTML tag <code>img</code>
      also allows for <abbr title="Uniform Resource
      Identifier">URI</abbr>s for the low-res version
      (<code>lowsrc</code> attribute), a long description
      (<code>longdesc</code>), and an client-side image-map
      (<code>usemap</code>).  <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext
      Mark-up Language">XHTML</abbr>&nbsp;2 also wants to add an
      <code>href</code> attribute to all elements (so any element in
      the document can be a link).  I’m not sure that XLink
      defines <code>xlink:show</code> values for all of these.  Even
      if it does, we cannot have more than one simple XLink link per
      element (since we can only have one <code>xlink:href</code>
      attribute).  We could possibly follow the same system as <a
      href="http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/"><abbr title="XML Topic
      Maps">XTM</abbr></a>, with one child element per link:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;object style="width:400px; height:300px;"&gt;
  &lt;source xlink:href=&quot;myLogo.gif"/&gt;
  &lt;usemap xlink:href=&quot;#logoMap"/&gt;
  [My Logo]
&lt;/object&gt;</pre>
    <p>
      (Here we are assuming that the <abbr title="Document-Type Definition">DTD</abbr> is used to generate default
      values for the other Xlink attributes—but do we really
      want to rely on all XML browsers being <em>validating</em>
      browsers...?)
    </p>

    <p>
      The question is, will this work?  Yes, if we are using a
      specialized XHTML-2-savvy browser (one which understands
      <code>object</code> and <code>source</code>, and knows how to
      interpret them).  If the aim is to make XHTML&nbsp;2
      implementable using <em>only</em> XML + <abbr title="Cascading
      Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>&nbsp;2 + XLink + XBase, <em>without
      making XHTML a special case</em>, then the answer is no.
    </p>

    <p>
      The upshot of this is that, if the 
      <abbr title="World-Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> want to make 
      XHTML&nbsp;2 just another XML format, displayable in a generic
      XML browser, then it looks like XLink is not quite right for the
      job.  It may well be that I&nbsp;am missing something, and the
      above example can be reworked to work with XLink.  It might be
      that <code>lowsrc</code> and <code>longdesc</code> are dumb
      features that no-one wants to carry over in to XHTML&nbsp;2
      anyway.  But my na&iuml;ve understanding of XLink and the nascent 
      XHTML&nbsp;2 suggests that the XHTML working group might have a
      point.  
    </p>

    <p>
      How is this going to end?  Right now it looks to an outsider
      like the question is being discussed less in terms of technical
      issues like what XHTML’s goals are, and more in terms of
      committees and procedure and politics and such-like.  We may end
      up with an XHTML&nbsp;2 that requires a specialized XHTML&nbsp;2
      browser (requiring upgrades to existing browsers that recognize
      the XML namespaces or the <code>DOCTYPE</code>, or any of the
      other stupid heuristics in use today to distinguish different
      flavours of HTML).  The dawn of XML as a fully-fledged hypertext
      mark-up language will delayed by a few more years...
    </p>

    <p>
      I&nbsp;really should not be writing about this—I&nbsp;have
      plenty of other things to work on.  I&nbsp;just find it
      difficult to tune out all these arguments about XHTML when
      that’s what I&nbsp;work with every day...

      In an <a href="../2002/09.html#e20020912">earlier note</a> I&nbsp;listed
      four namespaces used in
      <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> and <abbr
      title="RDF Site Summary">RSS</abbr> for the same element names.
      One of these has now been unmade: the <a
      href="http://backend.userland.com/rss"><abbr title="Really
      Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr></a> specification never explicitly
      mentioned the namespace, but the sample file included an
      <code>xmlns</code> attribute.  While I&nbsp;was away in Canada,
      <a href="http://backend.userland.com/rss#extendingRss">this was
      removed</a> to ensure backward compatibility with
      RSS&nbsp;0.91.  This makes sense (there exist examples of
      applications that genuinely are  broken by this), but is kind of icky.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is still the old <abbr title="RDF Site
      Summary">RSS</abbr>&nbsp;0.9 format—which did use its own
      namespace—but given that even <abbr title="RDF Site
      Summary">RSS</abbr>&nbsp;1.0 did not preserve that, I&nbsp;think
      we can assume it is dead too.  I&nbsp;assume that the programs
      that were broken by the fleeting addition of the <abbr
      title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr>-2.0 namespace are
      also incapable of parsing <abbr title="RDF Site
      Summary">RSS</abbr>-1.0 data?
    </p>
    <p>
      I&nbsp;just tried printing a copy of the <abbr
      title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr>&nbsp;2.0 spec., but
      because he chose to use a fixed-width table for the text, it is
      clipped all down the right-hand side of the page, making it
      useless.  Goddammit!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Update</strong> (2002-10-14): 
      I&nbsp;have removed the namespace declaration from 
      <a href="../2002/rss091.xml">my experimental RSS feed</a>.

      Compared to the long staight organized roads through endless
      flat prarie of Alberta, even British motorways look like a maze
      of twisty little fog-bound lanes... let alone the back-streets
      of London or Oxford.  I’m surprised tourists
      from North America don’t get claustrophobia.

    <p>
      Alas!  What photos I took are on <a
      href="http://www.shareable.org/">Jamie Lokier</a>’s
      digital camera in far-off Bristol.  Well, I&nbsp;say far-off,
      but in Canadian terms it’s trivial, of course.
    </p>

    <p>
      I&nbsp;managed to throw my back out getting the suitcases lined
      up ready for driving to the flight home—one moment
      I&nbsp;was putting down Jeremy’s black bag, the next
      I&nbsp;was all curled up in agony.  Luckily I&nbsp;was able to
      unkink enough to hobble in to the car using a chair as an ersatz
      zimmerframe.  The airport at Calgary loaned me a wheelchair so
      I&nbsp;had no trouble getting through check-in and customs.  At
      Gatwick the wheelchairs have small back wheels, which means the
      occupant cannot wheel themselves, and instead must put up with
      being pushed around by an attendant.  This infuriates my sister
      Kate no end.  (She cannot use her own chair at the airport
      because wheelchairs have to be checked in as luggage.)
      I&nbsp;have also discovered that those electric golf-cart things
      are not as fun to be driven around in than you might hope.
      Still, <a
      href="http://www.livejournal.com/talkpost.bml?journal=cleanskies&itemid=57766">I&nbsp;am
      recovering my mobility now</a>.
