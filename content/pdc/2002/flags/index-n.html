    <h1>Australian Flags, 1901&mdash;2002</h1>
    <p>
      These graphics files were created by me, Damian Cugley
      using SVG and referring to the Australian
      <a href="http://www.ausflag.com.au/info/flagsact.html">Flags Act 1953</a>
      for information about the size, shape and positions of the features of the flag.  Union Jack instructions from
      <a href="http://www.jdawiseman.com/papers/union-jack/union-jack.html">Julian Wiseman&rsquo;s web site</a>.
      I created my own versions because I wanted some flags to illustrate
      an on-line quiz (a work project) and all the ones I could find on-line
      were on sites with complicated copyright notices which made me
      unsure whether I was supposed to copy them or not.
