Title: Door Zone Hazard Sign

Topics: cycling design idea

Here’s another idea of a hazard sign for cycle lanes, continuing form [my previous post][0]. Cyclists sometimes travel too near the left edge of the road, or too close to parked cars for safety. Cycle lanes should not encourage this.

<blockquote>
    <div>
        <a href="door.png"><img src="door.png" alt="(black diamond)" style="height:8em"></a>
        <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/pete.meg/wcc/facility-of-the-month/October2001.htm"><img src="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/pete.meg/wcc/facility-of-the-month/TrumpingtonRoad.jpg" alt="(photo of a cycle lane)" style="height:8em"></a>

    </div>
</blockquote>

Here’s my proposed sign, and a few illustrations of places that might use it. The [first example][4] is in Cambridge (via [Cycle Facility of the Month][1]), the second in Oxford ([photo by me][2]).

This sign is possibly snarkier than some of the others, since it is only requred when the cycle lane was wrongly desgined in the first place: the [Sustrans guidelines][3] recommend a half-metre or metre-wide hatched separator between cars and lane, but this is rarely included because of lack of space. In these cases there should be no cycle lane painted. The attitude that any cycle lane is better than no cycle lane  needs to be challenged; obliging the council to include a hazard sign might help.
