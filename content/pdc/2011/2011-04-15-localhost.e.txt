Title: localhost Rage

When developing web sites, one needs to work with a copy of the site on
ones own computer. There is a special hostname `localhost` that always
means the computer you are working on—it never means anything else. So
it is very annoying when web browsers second-guess me and, on failing to
connect to `http://localhost:8080/`, ask me where I meant to type
`http://localhost.com:8000/`.

On my home computer I am running three localhost servers right now:

- `http://localhost/` is Apple‘s ‘web sharing’ server (an instance of Apache HTTPD);
- `http://localhost:8000/` is a working copy of <http://alleged.org.uk/>; and
- `http://localhost:8004/` is a working copy of <http://texturejam.org.uk/>

The port numbers in between are used when I am working on
<http://spreadsite.org/> or <http://jeremyday.org.uk/>, but those
servers are not running right now.

At work I have an six web servers running on my workstation between
working copies of parts of the web app and tools used in diagnosing
problems with user accounts.

# Why ‘localhost’?

In ancient times, when computers were shared by many people all
connecting with terminals via serial lines, the term _host_ (or
_terminal host_) was used for the computer that you connected to. Often
a given _site_ (university or research lab) had just the one host.

When networking between hosts was introduced, people talked of _remote
hosts_ (in a different site, connected via a network) and your
_local host_ (the one hosting your terminal). This usage survives as a
fossil in terms like _hostname_ and the conventional name `localhost`.
