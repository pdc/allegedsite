      Today <a href="../../jrd/">Jeremy</a> and I&nbsp;took the coach in
      <a href="http://www.londontransport.co.uk/">to London</a> to
      visit the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/">Tate
      Modern</a>.  We thought we had already missed the 2001 exhibit
      <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/surrealism/">Surrealism: Desire
      Unbound</a>, but no! we were in luck.  Some four hours later we
      tottered out, tired and £8·50 poorer but greatly edified.  They
      had one room which was basically gossip about the Surrealist
      movement members, illustrated with the books of poetry or
      collage or photographs that resulted.  Considering how chaste
      the period in question (1930s, 1940s) is usually represented in
      modern fiction, it’s interesting how many permutations they
      came up with: many in the Surrealism movement believed in what
      was then called free love and nowadays sometimes called <a
      href="http://www.polyamorysociety.org/">polyamory</a>.  The
      sections on <a
      href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/surrealism/room11.htm">erotic
      art</a> and <a
      href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/surrealism/room13.htm">erotic
      objects</a> was good fun.  Those crazy Czechs with their lewd
      photomontages and unspellable names!  <a
      href="http://livejournal.com/~cleanskies/day/2001/12/30">Jeremy</a> was
      annoyed that work <em>by</em> female Surrealists got little
      mention except in <a
      href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/surrealism/room12.htm">the
      room about Surrealism’s depiction <em>of</em> women</a>.
      This despite the women’s work being often being more
      interesting to the modern eye—the men’s talk of
      muses and idealized lovers looking more dated today (it was more
      radical in, say, 1930).  Bought a floppy clock (the Tate is
      taking the opportunity to sell more interesting merchandise) and
      then tried to figure out from where one was supposed to view the <a
      href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/unimunoz.htm">Juan
      Muñoz</a> installation.  First we looked down at it from the
      highest gallery level, but eventually we worked out you are
      supposed to look at it from below!  By this time the gallery was
      closing so we 
      staggered home feeling very culturally stimulated.

      I’m now back from a week-long visit to my mother’s in
      <a href="http://www.tobermory.mull.com/">Tobermory</a> on the
      Isle of <a
      href="http://fiss.com/districts/FI00516.htm">Mull</a>.  (<a
      href="http://www.isle.of.mull.com/">Mull</a> is an island off
      the west coast of Scotland with a total population of perhaps
      3000.)  Altogether we had my mum Jenny, her husband Dave, and
      their dogs Tubbs, Sacha, and Jerome; myself and Jeremy (from
      Oxford); my siblings Mike (<a
      href="http://fiss.com/districts/FI00565.htm">Dundee</a>), Kate
      (<a href="http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/">Brisbane</a> in <a
      href="http://www.house-of-tartan.scotland.net/gifhold/0611l5Australian.gif">Australia</a>),
      and Rachel (<a
      href="http://www.guildford.gov.uk/pages/tourism/tourism.htm">Guilford</a>);
      Mike’s baby son Darren; and sometimes Mum’s stray
      boy Iain and <em>his</em> dog Buster.  My reader will doubtless
      appreciate that even in a relatively large house this
      constitutes quite a crowd...  Still we survived with no
      casualties, and even got off the island and on the way home
      before the Great Storms began and the ferries were cancelled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Darren is 10 months old and cute as a button.  He spent a lot of
      his time on Mull crawling at speed up and down corrdidors and up
      and down the various adults who were trying to deflect him from
      anything heavy or small enough to try to eat or big enough to
      try to eat <em>him</em>.    Actually of my Mum’s dogs,
      Jerome (the biggest) is no threat; it is Sacha’s misguided
      attempts to mother him that might have been a problem if we had
      not kept an eye on him.

      amusing manner).  That said, the SVG animation needs more
      client-side CPU, and begins to get jerky on a 200-MHz

      Today I was visited by my mother and my sister Kate.  Since
      Kate uses a wheelchair I&nbsp;have learned a lot about the kerbs
      along the length of Cowley Road.  Ironically a lot of the

      <strong>SVG notes</strong>.
      I have tested it on Mozilla on Linux sans SVG; the fall-back PNG
      images display correctly.  MSIE 4.0 on Windows NT with Adobe SVG
      plug-in 3.0 displays the SVG correctly—you can zoom in and
      view SVG in another window etc.  And at work I&nbsp;verified
      (in MSIE 5&frac12;) you can print the page, in
      which case the pictures are rendered with the printer’s
      resolution, not the screen’s.  Cool!  MSIE/Mac 5.0 on my
      decrepit Performa sort of goes loopy while the SVG files
      download, then each doodle turns blank when you scroll the page;
      frobbing the the zoom or quality causes the image to redisplay.
      Weird.

      (I&nbsp;understand Debian GNU/Linux’s package manager will

      I&nbsp;finally tackled the garden a bit, finished the repairs to
      my bike, and then walked to the train station (there being no
      useful busses on account of an anti-war march), bought the

      to Toys ’R’
      Us where we tried to find toys to suit our respective nephews

      son Darren is not quite a year old yet (born 03-02-01),
      he’s something of a challenge to find suitable toys for.
      Then <a
      href="../../jrd/20010507.html">on to
      Habitat</a> to check out this season’s fairy lights and
      try out sofas we could not house even if we could afford them.
      On the way home we dropped in at the local Odeon to watch
      <cite>The Others</cite>, an excellent ghost story in which
      Nichole Kidman does very good mad starey eyes.

      Think</a> on Dave Winer’s weblog <a
      href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting.com</a>...  My
      experiences with HIV/AIDS have been mainly through working with
      organizations like London Lighthouse (since absorbed in to the
      <a href="http://www.tht.org.uk/">Terrance Higgins Trust</a>) and
      <a href="http://www.idt.org.uk/">the Immune Development
      Trust</a> on behalf of <a href="http://www.oxfordcc.co.uk/">my
      employer</a>.  Well, before that I&nbsp;had bought <cite>Strip
      AIDS</cite> (which funded the founding of Lighthouse), and of
      course I&nbsp;was at university in the late 1980s when
      discussion of AIDS, safer sex, and celibacy was at its peak.  It
      was partly because of that that I was so pleased that
      OCC’s membership of the SEAHORSE project gave me a chance
      to contribute something to HIV/AIDS support, even if (like most
      European R&amp;D projects) the main result was <a
      href="http://www.seahorse.oxi.net/">an obscure web site</a>.
      I&nbsp;thought I&nbsp;knew a reasonable amount about HIV, but
      meeting real people and visiting the Lighthouse makes it real in
      a way book-learning.  I&nbsp;was slightly in awe of the guys who
      had been living with HIV for a decade or more—they
