My old [Performa 5260][2] is running Mac OS 9, the last Macintosh operating
system for the old pre-G3 computers.  We have Quark installed thereon,
and it wants to print.  The printer is a [PostScript][1]-enabled HP
LaserJet 4MP, attached to my Linux server.  Why is it so hard to print
the damn' file?  Even during that brief time when it would work, I
could never get landscape printing to work.

I can choose the LaserWriter 8 icon in Chooser, but then it asks where
my AppleTalk network is.  As it happens, I *do* run an AppleTalk
server (`netatalk`) on the Linux box, and I even run something called
`papd`, but neither the Max OS 9 dinosaur nor the Mac OS X 10.2.8
PowerBook believe it has any printers.

There is a solution: the document is only one page long, so use
Quark's Save as Encapsulated PostScript option, then copy the EPS to a
shared disc on the Linux server.  Then edit the EPS with GNU Emacs.
Study the PostScript code to deduce the start of the page (in this
case, search for `%%EndSetup`).  Insert `0 842 translate -90 rotate`
to switch it to landscape printing, and voil&agrave;! it prints
correctly with `lpr`.  The great thing about Unix is that it lets you
point to a file and say 'send that to the printer' without its playing
silly buggers and trying to load some application's random Print
dialogue boxes and then second-guessing you on the whole landscape
printing issue so cleverly that your document emerges rotated and
clipped.

I have the Adobe manaual (_PostScript Lanugage Reference Manual_ 2/e,
ISBN 0-201-18127-4), which has an exellent index and is full of
information.  Thus I was able to learn how to insert `<< /NumCopies 10
>> setpagedevice` in order to print multiple copies.  Simplicity
itself compared to the user-friendly alternatives.
