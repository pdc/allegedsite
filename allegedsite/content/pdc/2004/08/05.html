   calling <a href="../../2004/07/17.html" title="MU: A notation for mark-up">MU</a>.  In this note I compare MU to some other mark-up notations.
</p>

<h2> MU compared with HTML</h2>
<p>MU is intended to generalize what is a reasonable HTML-style document.
   The intention is that the addition of a standard <a href="../../2004/07/19.html" title="MU part 2: Clear as MUD">MUD</a> file and style sheets, 
   a generic MU processor would be able to grok a large subset of
   extant HTML documents. Obviously there will still be documents that are
   not well-formed MU any more than they are well-formed HTML, and
   processors may still need to do some second-guessing.
</p>
<p>There is no <code>!DOCTYPE</code> declaration, and no SGML-style DTD. The equivalent is the <code>mud</code>
   attribute of the media type.  As a special case, we might define a
   special <code>text/html+mu</code> media type defined so that
</p>
<pre>
text/html+mu; charset=UTF-16
</pre>

<p>is the same as
</p>
<pre>
text/mu; charset=UTF-16; mud="http://www.w3.org/2005/html.mud"
</pre>

<p>where the specified MUD file contains <code>character</code> and <code>no-range tags</code>
   sections that define the HTML syntax, <code>view</code> sections naming appropriate
   CSS style sheets, and a <code>features</code> list including all the HTML modules.
</p>
<p>Unlike HTML, there is no attempt to define the default charset as
   anything other than US-ASCII, thus avoiding conflict with the MIME RFCs.
   (On the other hand, if the document has no reported charset then
   processors’ behaviour is undefined, and may include attempts to glean
   the charset from analysis of the byte patterns.)
</p>
<p>MU documents can contain namespace-prefixed tags (declared in the MUD),
   but the prefix is only required when there is a name collision; tags
   without a prefix are taken as being in whichever namespace allows them
   to be recognized by one of the activated features. This allows for
   extensions (like [Apple’s <code>canvas</code> tag][canvas], for example) without
   having every other tag adorned with prefixes.
</p>
<p>MU would prefer that document metadata – such as title, links, and
   suchlike – live externally to the document data. In an HTTP or MIME
   context, the natural place for title and suchlike is the headers; on
   disc there would be a META resource containing the same information. In
   particular, a document should not be an authority for its own encoding;
   that leads to confusion. For HTML compatibility, there would have to be
   features that can be mentioned in the MUD file to activate embedded
   metadata for compatibility.
</p>
<p>Many HTML processors use ‘<code>DOCTYPE</code> switching’ to select different
   quirks to match the bugs in other programs. With MU, you are supposed to
   be able to use the <code>features</code> section of the MUD file to assert the need
   for different processing models or whatever.
</p>

<h2> MU compared with XML</h2>
<p>MU does not have a <code>!DOCTYPE</code> declaration, <code>PUBLIC</code> identifier for its
   DTD, or a DTD. The functions of the XML DTD are
</p>
<ul>
 <li><p>defining default attributes (MU does not have default attribute
     values);
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>some checks for document validity (MU would use external validators,
     in the style of Relax NG and XSD);
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>defining entities (MU restricts entities to chacter entities and can
     define them in the MUD file).
</p>
<p>In addition, SGML DTDs can alter the syntax by defining some
   element-types as empty; MU does that through the MUD file.
</p>

 </li>
</ul>
<p>  define them in the MUD file).
</p>
<p>In addition, SGML DTDs can alter the syntax by defining some
   element-types as empty; MU does that through the MUD file.
</p>
<p>MU has namespaces, but they are defined in the MUD file rather than
   in-line (saving on typing, if nothing else). It also treats unqualified
   tag-names differently, allowing them to be in whichever vocabulary makes
   most sense. Some of the functions XML uses namespaces for are achieved
   through feature declarations in the MUD. 
</p>
<p>MU does not have XML’s <code>encoding</code> pseudo-attribute; instead MU requires
   that external metadata be used to establish the conversion from
   bytes to characters. My <a href="../../2004/08/03.html" title="META files for HTML + XML encoding happiness">META</a> proposal is intended to shore up those
   operating systems that have problems in this regard.
</p>
<p>MU does not have <code>NOTATION</code> definitions. 
</p>
<p>XML models the document as an ordered tree of nodes, the leaf nodes
   being text nodes or empty elements. MU considers a document to be a
   character sequence, with some ranges (possibly overlapping) tagged with
   optional attributes. Where XML is a semi-plausible format for exchanging
   non-document datasets (such as serialized database tables, RSS, and
   XML-RPC), in the world of MU, one might prefer <a href="http://yaml.org" title="Yaml Ain’t Mark-up Language">YAML</a> for those tasks.
</p>

<h2> Compared with LMNL</h2>
<p> <a href="http://www.lmnl.net/" title="The Layered Mark-up and aNnotation Language">LMNL</a> is another mark-up language firmly rooted in the concept of
   marking up text. Like MU, tags mark ranges that may overlap. LMNL has a
   properly worked out processing model that MU would steal wholesale.
   LMNL
   uses a different microsyntax, with start tags written
   <code>[par}</code> and end tags <code>{par]</code>.  This addresses neatly one of the
   annoyances of SGML-derived languages, the one-character difference between <code>&lt;foo&gt;</code> and
   <code>&lt;/foo&gt;</code>. It also gives them an unambguous empty-range notation:
   <code>[img]</code>.
</p>
<p>LMNL has a much more powerful
   attribute syntax – each annotation’s value is potentially a LMNL text layer,
   whereas MU, like XML and HTML, limits attribute values to unstructured character
   data. I believe that all MU documents can be trivially converted to
   LMNL, and LMNL documents with simple enough attributes can be
   transformed to MU.
</p>
