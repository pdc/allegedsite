Title: Stolen tabs!

Having taken a week off work, I have belatedly updated the [CAPTION
2004][1] web site.  It includes tabbed sections using a technique
taken from the article [Sliding Doors of CSS][2] on the [A List
Apart][3] web site.

In fact I did not just steal the technique, I stole the exact same
graphics (rather than drawing up my own) since   the colour and shape were
right anyway.  

The backgrounds use a picture by Carla plus Eric Meyer's '[Complex
Spiral][4]' technique for creating the illusion of translucent
backgrounds to the text (the text should look like it is printed on
translucent rectangles hovering over the background drawing; this will
not work properly in Microsoft Internet Explorer, however, so I might
have to take it out).

I have also shamelessly switched to using Unicode's
typographically-correct quotation marks: 'thus' rather than
ASCII-era ersatz punctuation
&apos;thus&apos;.  I am hoping that this will not attract too much
approbium.
