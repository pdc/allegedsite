I already mentioned [Ausflag][1] and their mission to persuade the
powers that be that retaining the British Union flag in the Australian
flag is a little out of date given that Australia has been an
independent nation since 1986.  They ran [a competition for a
replacement flag][1a] with [results announced in 2000][1b].  I have
added my version of Franck Gentil's competition winner to my SVG-based
flag collection. This is it in PNG format:

<img src="../2002/flags/ausflag2000-92-var-240h.png" width="480"
height="240" class="bigflag" alt="(Flag)" />

If you are using a sufficiently old web browser, you should also be
able to see the SVG version:

type="image/svg+xml" width="480" height="240" class="bigflag" alt="(Flag)" />

My version of the design differs from the version shown in the
competition in that (a) I have retained the 2:1 width-to-height ratio,
and (b) the stars are all the same size as in the existing flag,
whereas Mr Gentil's version increases their sizes slightly.

Compared with the existing 1908 flag, the differences are as follows.
Apart from the obvious omission of the British flag from the top left,
I found that I needed to adjust the positions of the federation star
and the Southern Cross to make the the flag look reasonably balanced.
If you imagine the flag split in to one-third and two-thirds sections,
the federation star is defined by a circle centred in the left third,
and the Southern Cross has been moved to be centred in the right
two-thirds.

The division in to thirds pleases me because it is consistent with the
'Australian pale', a [uniquely Australian vexillological style][2]
(_vexilology_ means the study of flags, and _per pale_ being the
heraldry term for dividing the field in two vertically).

**Edit** (2004-07-19).  I started this entry a few days ago but ended
up debugging my home network settings rather than finishing it.  So
most of the above text was actually written today.
