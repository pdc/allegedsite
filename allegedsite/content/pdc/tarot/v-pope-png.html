        At the time the tarot decks were first devised (Italy around
        the 14th or 15th century), the Pope was a fact of life and a
        figure of religious and social authority&mdash;in those days
        religion defined society in a way we cannot really imagine today.
        This card stands for the institutions and authorities of society.
        It also symbolizes spiritual or religious teaching or advice, or,
        more loosely, professional advice in general (such as from your
        soliciter).  In modern decks this card has been renamed The
        Hieriphant, a reference to a professional religious advisor in
        classical times.
      </p>
      <p>
        In magical tradition, the Pope is also the third authority
        figure in the body&ndash;mind&ndash;spirit ensemble.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my Alleged Tarot I&nbsp;have used the older names for some
        of the cards.  The reason for this is that my original Pebble
        Tarot was based on the tarot deck I&nbsp;had at the time&mdash;the
        
        <a href="http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/1jjswiss/index.html">1JJ Swiss tarot</a>,
        
        and that uses the old card names.  My Pope was
        the most popular card amongst my friends, and if I&nbsp;wanted to
        retain the Pope it followed I&nbsp;would be using the old names
        for the other cards too.  You can tell he&rsquo;s the Pope because
        he has a fancy hat and a kissable ring.  He is also making the
        mystic hand signal which means &lsquo;as above (in the spirit
        world), so below (in the material world)&rsquo;.  The Hierophant
        is often decorated with a pentacle; I&nbsp;have alluded to that in
        the five-pointed star on his Pope hat.
