<div><img src="../2005/../wp/icon-64x64.png" alt="" align="left" width="64" height="64" border="0" /></div><p class="first">Recently the term ‘folksonomy’ has been coined to refer to the use of
   unstructured keywords to classify and group resources collaboratively
   (’resources’ as in photos on <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> and links to web sites on
   <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>). Supposedly the experts on metadata are chagrined to
   discover that structured keywords, hierarchical taxonomies, and faceted
   metadata have been outdone by such a simple system. But this approach
   isn’t actually all that new.
</p>

<h2> The problems with metadata</h2>
<p>But first a little background, based on my own bitter experience!
   In 1997 I comprised the entire technical staff on a multinational
   European project to create an on-line repository of information on HIV
   and Aids called <a href="http://seahorse.oxi.net/" title="Self-help, empowerment, and awareness of HIV/AIDS: the on-line research and support exchange">SEAHORSE</a>, after a year-long feasibility study in
   1995 where I was the one arguing that we exploit this new-fangled WWW
   concept to distribute information, rather than creating our own
   ISDN-based network!
</p>
<p>Mostly SEAHORSE was about linking to the
   growing corpus of material already existing, since there was no budget
   for creating original material. It seemed to me that a good approach
   would be to tag the web sites and documents we linked to with one or
   more categories, and have the user choose a cluster categories to search
   for documents. For example, suppose a certain drug r&eacute;gime gives
   you brittle toe nails, and eating more grapes will ameliorate this
   symptom: a page describing this would be annotated with the names of the
   drug, ‘toe nails’, and ‘grapes’. The challenges with this are fairly
   obvious:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     authority (people can disagree on how pertinent a page is);
 </li>

 <li>
     homonyms (same word, but different meanings);
 </li>

 <li>
     synonyms (different words with the same meaning); 
 </li>

 <li>
     hypernyms (this word is a more general concept than that one);
 </li>

 <li>
     localization (the web site had to be multilingual); and
 </li>

 <li>
     navigation (how to choose your cluster of categories).
 </li>
</ul>
<p>The issue of <strong>authority</strong> was especially interesting because during the
   1980s and early 1990s, the subject of HIV and Aids was one where people
   with Aids often knew more about it than many medical professionals, and
   there were many people who were publishing information that did not go
   through an academic peer-review. Even within our consortium we had the
   Immune Development Trust emphasizing complementary medicine (and now
   renamed the <a href="http://www.comphealth.org.uk/">Complementary Health Trust</a>), and London Lighthouse (now
   assimilated into the <a href="http://www.tht.org.uk/">Terrence Higgins Trust</a>) working with
   conventional medicine. My solution was to partition the annotations in
   to annotation-sets (later renamed repositories because <em>annotation set</em>
   was considered too technical a term) and to allow users to select which
   annotation sets to actually use information from (a <strong>profile</strong> of the system). 
</p>
<p>The problem with <strong>homonyms</strong> I can easiest illustrate with a
   hypothetical couple of Flickr posts: one from a fishing trip and one of
   a jazz quartet, both tagged with <em>bass</em>.  When I’m searching for bass,
   the fish, how do I avoid hits for bass, the instrument? (For that matter,
   how do I google for information on the Latin language or latin
   alphabets without instead discovering web sites devoted to pictures of incompletely clothed Americans of Spanish
   descent?)  The solution is to organize the concepts in to some sort of
   hierarchy, so that you can have <em>objects/musical instruments/stringed/bass</em>
   distinguished from <em>nature/animals/fish/bass</em>, say. In directories like
   the original Yahoo and the present <a href="http://dmoz.org/">DMOZ</a>, you locate categories by
   navigating from general categories to more specific ones, and I took
   that as my model for my SEAHORSE prototype. 
</p>
<p> <strong>Synonyms</strong> are tricky because different people will choose different
   words to represent the same subject, often <strong>hypernyms</strong> (more generic
   terms) or <strong>hyponyms</strong> (more specific words). For example, using our
   hypothetical bass photos again, if I searched for tags like
   <em>micropterus</em>, <em>fish</em>, <em>double bass</em>, or <em>strings</em>, it would not match
   <em>bass</em>. This is where a prearranged collection of categories is useful:
   by either requiring people to choose from a list, we avoid confusion
   caused by synonyms; hypernyms and hyponyms by treating a page tagged
   with <em>nature/animals/fish/bass</em> as implictly being tagged with
   <em>nature/animals/fish</em>, <em>nature/animals</em>, and <em>nature</em>. This ends up with
   what amounts to a <strong>controlled vocabulary</strong> or <strong>taxonomy</strong>, where a
   bunch of wise people come up with a standardized list of categories in advance to
   be used by everyone else. There might or might not be arrangements for
   extending the taxonomy as new concepts are required. 
</p>
<p>In a way <strong>localization</strong> is similar to the synonym problem: this
   project was pan-European, and we were working on the assumption that it
   would sometimes be useful for a non-English-speaker to be directed to
   English-language resoures (they might be able to get someone to
   translate them once they’ve found them). The approach taken was to use
   numbers to represent categories internally, so that number 356 might be
   named <em>fish</em> in English and <em>poisson</em> in French. Unlike DMOZ, I did not
   split the hierarchy in to segments based on language: all languages
   shared a common taxonomy, translated in to that language.  We did not
   have any budget ear-marked for translation, so I designed the system so
   that volunteers could supply translations gradually and piecemeal. If a
   new category was added in English, and you visited Greek version of the
   site, you would see the English word until the Greek translation was
   added.
</p>
<p>For navigation I followed the lead of Yahoo and other directory web
   sites (most people have forgotten it now, but Yahoo started life as
   the first attempt at a directory for the whole WWW). This meant that
   most pages had a list of cataegories, and clicking on them lead to a
   page containing their subcategories, and so on, until you found the page
   with the precise category you were after, and the list of links and
   articles related to that category. 
</p>

<h2> The problems with the solutions</h2>
<p>There were all sorts of problems with the GUI for a variety of reasons.
   Partly this was lack of development time: I was the sole developer on
   the whole project, which is rather remarkable considering there were
   about twenty people working on the project. I was expecting
   there to be another person working on the UI proper, with me supplying
   the back-end code that handled the links and categories and so on. I
   structured my code accordingly: I had a test framework to allow me to
   exercise the innards of the program and index the fifty sites that I had
   been given (on paper) to prime the pump. As it turned out, the
   consortium partner with responsibility for the UI had never used a
   computer (she had a friend to ‘do the photoshopping’ bit), so that
   responsibility devolved to me. 
   We ended up adapting my Yahoo-style test rig as the public face of
   SEAHORSE.
</p>
<p>The upshot of this was that we designed the application backwards: first
   the underlying model, then a user interface, then inventing use cases to fit the UI.
</p>
<p>There were two big problems with this. First, we had no way for the
   reader to choose to search using more than one category, since the only
   way to choose one was to visit its page. Second, creating new
   categories, and tagging links with categories, was a clumbersome process.
   It made sense for my test rig to have a Create Category page separate
   from the Add Link page, because I wanted to be able to create all these
   various objects independently of each other during testing; quite
   another thing to expect volunteers to click through several pages in
   order to register one lousy link.
</p>
<p>As a result of this, no-oner quite grasped the idea of a page being
   tagged with <em>many</em> categories. It also meant <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000058.html" title="User Interface Design for Programmers Chapter 2: Figuring Out What They Expected">they never saw any
need</a> to create the fine-grained categorization scheme I had
   envisiaged. I did not matter that I had documented all this; <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000062.html" title="User Interface Design for Programmers Chapter 6: Designing for People Who Have Better Things To Do With Their Lives">users
don’t read documentation</a>.
</p>
<p>It got worse. We added a hierarchical list of categories with
   progressive display (Microsofties call this a TreeView), which was nice
   (once I had worked out how to make it display fast). But this just
   encouraged people to think of categories as being like folders. My boss
   started talking about our clever use of the ‘Windows Explorer metaphor’.
   We redesigned their icons to look like folders.  It didn’t really matter
   what I said: they became folders to everyone else.<br/>
</p>
<p>No-one else on the project seemed to grasp my attempts at empowering the
   user to choose whose reputations to trust (the annotation-sets and
   profiles and suchlike). It just meant extra user-interface clutter that
   they did not care about and just got in their way. Soon they were asking
   me to create folders for ‘their’ metadata to go in,
   which was pretty much the end of any attempt to make categories be used
   for organizing pages by topic.
</p>
<p>What about people who want to contribute to the database? Our users were
   ‘empowered’ to <em>suggest</em> additions to the linkbase that would not be
   published on the site until checked by an agent of one of the consortium
   partners. This was to ‘preserve quality’. What it meant, of course, was
   that we gave no reward to casual readers volunteering information, so
   they would wander off to a web site that did.
</p>
<p>There is also a big problem with deeply hierarchical taxonomies: people
   don’t like them, and they won’t use them. Consider <em>Roget’s Thesaurus</em>,
   which originally was all about subdivision of concepts in to collections
   of terms for describing that concept: it was never successful until an
   alphabetical index was added, so that people could look up <em>excellence</em>
   without the trouble of trying to work out where it belonged in Roget’s
   system. Similarly, have a look at the front page of <a href="http://dmoz.org/">DMOZ</a>: can you
   guess which of these very abstract top-level categories will be
   concealing an entry for <em>bass</em>? I had to use the search box to find it.
   Yahoo started as a directory, but has long since sidelined that in
   favour of free-text search and other features.
</p>
<p>The SEAHORSE hierarchy is particularly bad because it was created
   <em>before</em> tagging any documents, not after. As a result, its top few levels
   are cluttered with concepts that no-one is particularly interested in,
   and you have to dig deep to find anything of interest. This is a common
   problem with taxonomies that are designed before a large body of work
   has been analysed to see what topics actually are needed, and actually
   are useful enough to be worth emphasizing. 
</p>
<p>Another thing that undermined SEAHORSE was the time it took to come
   on-line.  By 1999 there were many web sites with HIV and Aids
   information; you could take your choice of providers of information.
   Other things that were good for people but bad for SEAHORSE were
   statutory organizations’ catching up with HIV research, which made
   grass-roots medical publications largely obsolete, and combination
   therapies: people with HIV were suddenly finding themselves
   in the position of being able to resume the lives they had had to
   abandon when they became sick. As a result there were simply fewer
   people available with any time for and interest in contributing  
   to a community-based HIV/Aids information resource.
</p>

<h2> Lessons</h2>
<p>When I came to be throwing together the software that generates this web
   site, I wanted to be able to categorize my articles.  I decided to
   eschew all the clever formalisms and try to invent the simplest thing
   that could possibly work.  Articles for this site are plain text files,
   starting with an RFC-2822-style header (but I do not support all the hairiness of  RFC
   2822), followed by the text of the article in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> format
   (older articles are in XML).  
   One of the headers is <code>Topic</code>, and it contains keywords separated by
   spaces.  There is a file, <code>subjects.data</code>, that lists these keywords on
   separate lines with a properly spelled version of the name:
</p>
<pre>
...
pbmplus: PBMPlus
markdown: Markdown
pymarkdown: pyMarkdown
zeo: &lt;abbr title="Z Enterprise Objects">ZEO&lt;/abbr>
zodb: &lt;abbr title="Z Object Database">ZODB&lt;/abbr>
...
</pre>

<p>The page <a href="../2005/../2003/subjects.html">subjects.html</a> is made by scanning the articles for
   keywords and making the links automatically. The idea here was to make
   it as easy as possible to add categories, but still to allow for their
   names to use the features of HTML.  The topics are arranged in the file
   in a fashion I vaguely intended one day to use to group the topics into
   a hierarchy.  But (unlike SEAHORSE) I intentionally concentrated on
   making adding the topics easy, while leaving scope for more complicated
   stuff later.
</p>
<p>This is reminiscent of the ‘worse is better’ debates that used to rage
   between Lisp and C enthusiasts. Lispy culture emphasized the ‘better is
   better’ approach, where you would decide ahead of time exactly how
   something would work, and implement that correctly and without
   compromise. C hackers were content to come up with something that was
   easy to implement and work around the imperfections. The WWW is often
   cited as another example: HTML solved the problem of broken links that
   had been concerning hypertext experts for decades by simply ignoring it.
</p>
<p> <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> wisely give usability precedence over
   all other concerns, and use essentially the same system. Entering a set
   of as many categories as you like is a simple matter of banging in the
   names with your keyboard. Unlike my site (which is static HTML), they
   both allow you to search using multiple tags in combination.
</p>
<p>The problems of synonyms, homographs, and localization have been dealt
   with by ignoring them: the problems are not <em>bad
enough</em> to be worth the cost of solving them. If the alternative is the
   complexity that stifled SEAHORSE, then they are right to do so.  
   Some people are aware of the hypernym problem, and can address it themselves
   by using multiple tags. For example, I tagged <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pdc/507133/">my photos of the
Westminster clock tower</a> with <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pdc/tags/london/">_london_</a> in addition to
   <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pdc/tags/westminster/">_westminster_</a>. This gives much of the benefit of  a hierarchical
   geographical taxonomy, without the inconvenience of the hierarchical
   taxonomy itself.
</p>
<p>If synonyms are a big enough problem in the longer term, we can think
   about clustering tags together using loose look-up tables. Flickr
   already do this to an extent: if you visit the page for a tag, as well
   as listing photos with that tag, it also lists tags that are often found
   associated with the same photos. Other forms of analysis might be able
   to derive structured keywords from the unstructured tags: and this will
   work better <em>because</em> tags are so easy to add, which means there will be
   enough of them to do decent statistical analysis on.
</p>
<p>This will not be completely straightforward.
   Different people make up words according to their own ideas, and
   the result is that sometimes tags are not used the way you might expect.
   But if people find that clustering of tags makes Flickr more fun for
   them, then they will take more care over choosing their own tags to
   increase the number of matches. Flickr allows you to change the spelling
   of existing tags to correct typos.
</p>
<p>You could also (if you really cared) piggy-back a structured vocabulary
   on top of Flickr’s tags. <a href="http://topicmaps.org/">ISO Topic Maps</a> allow for a topic to be
   identified by any number of subject indicators (that is, URLs used to
   identify a subject). I could publish a topic map in which I describe the
   topic identified by my tag <a href="http://del.icio.us/pdc/programming">http://del.icio.us/pdc/programming</a> and how
   it relates to other topics, including ones identified by other users’
   tags, thus merging our taxonomies in arbitratrily subtle and nuanced
   ways. 
</p>
<p>Just remember what the corpses of countless overdesigned metadata
   projects tell us: subtlty is not everything.
