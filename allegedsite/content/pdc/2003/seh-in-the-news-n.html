      <h1>St Edmund Hall makes the news?</h1>

<p>
      My former college, <a
      href="http://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/">St Edmund Hall</a>, has
      made the news: The <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite> published an
      article about the alcoholic bingeing of its students&mdash;or
      rather, an <a
      href="http://www.oxfordstudent.com/2003-03-06/news/4">inaccurate
      report of an alcohol ban</a> (as pointed out by <cite>Oxford
      Student</cite>).  This was picked up by <a
      href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/"><cite>Today</cite></a>
      (and <a
      href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2816757.stm">BBCi</a>,
      which claims <abbr title="St Edmund Hall">SEH</abbr> has
      cloisters and a front gate resembling
      <abbr title="The Queen&rsquo;s College">Queen&rsquo;s</abbr>?)
      and the <cite>Guardian</cite>:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
      Yesterday, St Edmund Hall, reputed to be the booziest of
      the Oxford colleges, lifted its ban on alcohol - a measure
      imposed after puke levels threatened to overwhelm the place in
      the manner of the sea after global warming. While registering
      the unseemliness of posh students pissing (literally) away their
      tuition fees, the tone of the media coverage was largely
      nostalgic. Here were students doing what they do best: getting
      wrecked and falling over, in the long and proud tradition of
      British undergraduate life.  (<a
      href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,907600,00.html">Emma
      Brockes, in the <cite>Guardian Unlimited</cite></a>)
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      SEH is not unique in suffering from puking outbreaks and loutish
      behaviour by drunks.  They just made the news because they
      belatedly tried to do something about it.
      </p>
      <p>
      There is a somewhat desperate attempt to invoke nostalgia for <a
      href="http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/B/htmlB/bridesheadre/bridesheadre.htm"><cite>Brideshead
      Revisited</cite></cite></a> (it was even cited in the Torygraph
      headline), which must be a bit annoying for the growing minority
      of Oxford students who are not privately educated.  Any
      connection between traditionally &lsquo;hearty&rsquo;
      <abbr title="St Edmund Hall">Teddy Hall</abbr>
      and alcoholic binges is more likely to do with rowing and rugby
      than the sort of refined chap who has a teddy bear and valet.
      </p>
      <p>
      The sordid truth is that students today (Oxford no exception)
      are doing what young Britons have been doing since forever,
      which is drinking as much booze as they can afford.  Despite
      taxes, the real cost of drinking as a proportion of income has
      declined markedly over the years.  As a result, instead of
      grimly nursing a single pint all evening, your average
      18-year-old can afford to drink a crate or two of alcopops in a
      sitting.  They can also afford to go out drinking several nights
      a week.  It&rsquo;s not as if eking out one&rsquo;s grant to
      last the rest of term is a meaningful goal these days...
      </p>
      <p>
      My suggestion for addressing the increasing problem of young men
      relieving themselves in the streets is a shaming campaign.
      Perhaps signs inside the exits to pubs and clubs saying
      &lsquo;Mother says: Go before you Go, boys!&rsquo; and spot
      fines for public urination (you would need unusually bold police
      officers to enforce that one, however).
      </p>
      <p>
      And those people who keep going on about how getting legless is
      an essential part of student life can be drafted on to clean-up
      duty.
