		This September Jeremy and Damian visited Damian&rsquo;s mother Jenny Cugley in her home in Tobermory on the Isle of Mull.
		      It&rsquo;s a bit of a mixture&mdash;forest scenes from walking
		      the dogs (my mother has 5&ndash;6 dogs in the house at a time,
		      some of them borrowed from friends), or from visiting Aros Park
		      on our own.   There are some close-ups of little stuff as
		      I&nbsp;tested the (super)macro lens on my digital camera.
