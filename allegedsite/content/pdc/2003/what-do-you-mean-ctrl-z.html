      <p>
      During an attempt to better organize a collection of <abbr
      title="Microsoft Transact-SQL">T-SQL</abbr> scripts I&nbsp;came
      across a strange behaviour when converting Windows
      ANSI (8-bit character data) to Unicode (16-bit character data)
      which appears, surprisingly, to involve the ancient
      <abbr title="Microsoft Disk Operating System">MS-DOS</abbr>
      convention of using Ctrl-Z (character 0x1A) to end files.
      </p>
      <p>
      <img src="dbicon.png" width="93" height="91" alt=""
      align="left" />
      The whole things started because I&nbsp;wanted a better
      alternative to the system we had for reproducing databases.  We
      are, for no particular reason, using SQL databases to implement
      a document model: each document is implemented as a separate
      database.  To create a &lsquo;blank&rsquo; database suitable for
      new document, the algorithm is to:
      </p>
      <ol>
      <li>
      In one database-maintenance program (called Enterprise
      Manager), show the New Database dialog, enter the database
      name.  Before pressing OK <em>copy and past the underlying
      file names in to an instance of Notepad</em>.  Normally the
      underlying files used by the database are of no interest
      (isn&rsquo;t that the point of having a
      <abbr title="Database Management System">DBMS</abbr>?), but you
      will need these later.
      </li>
      <li>
      We supply a back-up file of a blank database (with the tables,
      stored procedures, and initial content set up).  Copy this on
      to one of the hard discs of the server.  In the Restore Backup
      dialogue, choose New Device (strange terminology) and navigate
      to the backup file.  In the Options tab, copy and paste the
      file names saved in step one.  If you forgot to do this, then
      you will have to enter the file names from memory, or close
      the Restore dialogue, visit the database properties, stretch
      the window to be wide enough to show the file name (it
      isn&rsquo;t scrollable), and copy it down by hand, then start
      the Restore dialogue all over again.
      </li>
      <li>
      Having &lsquo;restored&rsquo; the back-up, visit its Users and
      Roles pages in Enterprise Manager to create the two special
      users that must be set up for the two programs that access the
      database.   Setting up the correct permissions
      (so they have access to the stored procedures they need and no
      others) is a tedious matter of more dialogue boxes.  Or
      instead you could  give both of them
      &lsquo;owner&rsquo; privileges, which is less secure but
      easier.
      </li>
      <li>
      In the special central database that lists the available
      &lsquo;documents&rsquo;, add a row with the new
      database&rsquo;s name and the identity number of the analyst
      who will be permitted to use it.
      </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      Having most of the database structure encoded as a back-up of a
      template database is a maintenance nightmare if you have more
      than one person working on them.  We have dozens of these
      multi-megabyte files on various developers&rsquo;s
      workstations&mdash;which is the latest one?  There is no way to
      examine them short of the above tedious rigamarole.  Updating a
      database template involves restoring it, altering whatever need
      fixing, and then going through a similar rigamarole to create a
      fresh backup file.
      </p>
      <p>
      My preference would be to store the information about the
      database structure and stored procedures etc. as <abbr
      title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> scripts.   Scripts
      can be entered in to a source-code control system like any
      other file, they can be examined and edited with text editors,
      and they are more compact.       Much of the script (the list of
      tables, the stored procedures) can be generated automatically.
      There is even a rudimentary template system built in to another
      database-maintenance tool (called SQL Query Analyser), which
      means the work required to create a new database boils down to:
      </p>
      <ol>
      <li>
      Visit the script template in Query Analyzer
      </li>
      <li>
      Type Ctrl+Shift+M or invoke Edit -&gt; Replace Template
      Parameters.  In the resulting dialogue box, enter the name
      for the new database and the analyst&rsquo;s user name.
      </li>
      <li>
      Press Go (or type F5) to run the script.  Done.
      </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      If scripts are simpler to work with, why do we (ab)use the
      backup system instead?  Basically because my colleagues were
      raised on Microsoft Access, where copying databases around like
      files is normal, and Microsoft Visual <abbr
      title="Beginner&rsquo;s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction
      Code">Basic</abbr>, which trains you never to type text when you
      could be clicking things with the mouse.  These are
      disadvantages when it comes to using a real SQL database and a
      language like Visual Basic .NET.  (That&rsquo;s the cruel
      irony&mdash;not being a <abbr title="veeby">VB</abbr>
      programmer, I&nbsp;am better at VB&nbsp;.NET programming than VB
      programmers are.)
      </p>
      <p>
      There is also the problem that the SQL script is very, very
      long.  The SQL scripts for related tasks are also very long, and
      have big overlaps.  So I decided on Tuesday to modularize my
      scripts in the simplest possible way: for each task,
      I&nbsp;create a directory named <code>Create Project</code>,
      say.  This holds a collection of SQL scripts.  Each has a
      friendly name prefixed with a sequence number (e.g., <code>050
      Languages&nbsp;1.sql</code>).  With a little defensive coding so
      that scripts can be rerun during debugging, each of these
      smaller scripts can be debugged independently.  Of course that
      means that the creating a new project now requires running 16
      scripts, which would be pretty tedious.
      </p>
      <p>
      My solution was to knock together a Python script that walks
      through the directory hierarchy of my new <code>Tasks</code>
      directory, and concatenates the script files to make the
      megascript, which is what end-users use.  The main wrinkles is
      that the scripts handling the <code>Languages</code> table
      contain Unicode character data, so must be stored in an
      appropriate encoding on disc.  SQL Server offers only one, which
      is <abbr title="UCS Transfer Format">UTF</abbr>-16 (actually
      UTF-16LE prepended with 0xFF 0xFE&mdash;see <a
      href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2781.txt">RFC&nbsp;2781</a> for
      details).  The other scripts tend to be stored in a single-byte
      encoding that Microsoft are pleased to call Windows ANSI (more
      generally known as <a
      href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/unicode/1252.htm">Windows-1252</a>).
      The Windows convention is to not distinguish between UTF-16 and
      single-byte-encoded files: you have to read the first two bytes
      and if they are not 0xFF 0xFE then the data is presumed to be in
      Windows-1252.
      </p>
      <p>
      In Python this is very straightforward:
      </p>
      <pre>input = file(inFileName, 'rt')
      text = input.read()
      input.close()
      
      if text[:2] == '\xFF\xFE':
      text = text.decode('UTF-16')</pre>
      <p>
      Writing an encoded file is also pretty simple:
      </p>
      <pre>output = codecs.open(outFileName, 'wt')
      ...output.write(text)...</pre>
      <p>
      <img src="U041A.png" width="115" height="146" alt=""
      title="U+041A CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER KA" align="right" />
      All was
      going well except that for some reason one of the files was only
      partly copied in to the long file&mdash;the text of the next
      file started in the middle of a line.  What gives?  I deleted
      the line in question and the same thing happened in another line
      mentioning the same language: <a
      href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/kirghiz.htm">Kyrgyz/Kirghiz
      (&#1050;&#1099;&#1088;&#1075;&#1099;&#1079;)</a>.  Hmm.  The
      first letter of the name is where the file gets chopped off.  It
      turns out that it is not a K, but is the Cyrillic letter
      &#x041A; U+041A CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER KA (see the <a
      href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0400.pdf">Unicode code
      chart</a>).  Its value means its encoding in UTF-16LE is the
      sequence 0x1A 0x04, which just happens to contain the MS-DOS
      end-of-file character (0x1A = Ctrl-Z).  Is this the cause of the
      problem?  (Or is it the presence of 0x04, the equivalent of
      Ctrl-D?)
      </p>
      <p>
      In the end the fix turned out to be to change the
      <code>rt</code> code in the first line in the first fragment
      above with <code>rb</code>.  The <code>t</code> means to do
      end-of-line conversions (the MS-DOS convention of <abbr
      title="0x0D Carriage Return, 0x0A Line Feed">CRLF</abbr> is
      translated to a single LF); the <code>b</code> means to leave
      well alone.  This means the rest of the program has to be
      careful to use <code>\r\n</code> rather than <code>\n</code>
      (since it will not be magically converted for me), but the
      script now worked correctly.  Phew!
