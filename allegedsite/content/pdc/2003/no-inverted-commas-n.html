      <h1>Alternatives to inverted commas</h1>

<p>
      Well, it is true that one can often infer whether a typewriter
      quotation mark is an apostrophe or turned comma according to its
      position. On the other hand, why bother having marks of
      quotation at all, since they can be guessed from the words
      anyway? Many prose writers despise quotation marks and just do
      not use them. It is increasingly popular to represent non-spoken
      words (such as a character&rsquo;s thoughts) in italics rather
      than set off by quotation marks.
      </p>

<p>
      While we&rsquo;re at it, do we need apostrophes anyway? George
      Bernard Shaw despised them and did not use them (he wrote
      <em>dont</em>, <em>cant</em>), except for words that would
      become ambiguous (such as <em>I&rsquo;ll</em>,
      <em>we&rsquo;re</em>). We could go futher by writing these as
      two words (<em>I ll</em>, <em>we r</em>), the elision of the
      vowels being implied by their not being written rather than the
      presence of a special mark.
      </p>

<p>
      <em>What about the possessive case?</em>, I hear you ask. Well,
      bear in mind that words like <em>Peter&rsquo;s</em>,
      <em>Anne&rsquo;s</em> are really abbreviations of an Anglo-Saxon
      declension or inclination or whatever the term is, and they
      could be written <em>Peteres</em>, <em>Annes</em>. After all, we
      no longer write <em>pass&rsquo;d</em>, <em>sort&rsquo;d</em> as
      Shakespeare might have; the suppression of the sound of the e is
      recognized by convention. Some spelling reformers have suggested
      the opposite tack, where the vowel is omitted: <em>passd</em>,
      <em>sortd</em> (and similarly for <em>akr</em> (acre),
      <em>theatr</em>). This gives us three apostrophe-free variations
      on the possessive case:
      </p>

<ul>
      <li>
      Peters, Annes (matches <em>his</em>, <em>hers</em>,
      <em>its</em>)
      </li>
      <li>
      Peteres, Annes (like <em>passed</em>=<em>pass&rsquo;d</em>)
      </li>
      <li>
      Peter s, Anne s (same logic as <em>I ll</em>, <em>we r</em>)
      </li>
      <ul>

<p>
      Spelling reformers might prefer Petrz, Anz!
      </p>

<p>
      Note the distinction between <em>cant</em> and <em>we
      r</em>. I dont favour <em>can nt</em>, because the
      pronounciation of <em>can</em> now depends on its being followed
      by <em>nt</em>. So it makes sense to write it <em>cant</em>. You
      have to guess from context that it is not intended to be the
      word <em>cant</em> (as in thieve s cant), just as you already
      have to distinguish <em>read</em> (sounds like <em>reed</em>)
      from <em>read</em> (sounds like <em>red</em>).
      </p>

      Hey! Let s get rid of hyphens and dashes too! Dashes in
      principle can be replaced by colons or commas, depending on how
      they are used. Hyphens appear in compound words like
      <em>X-ray</em> and <em>mother-in-law</em>. We could require
      these compounds to be spelled either as two words or as one and
      ban the halfway hyphenated comounds. Let s face it, most writers
      these days do anyway. Hyphens also appear in phrases used
      attributively, as in a <em>bright-red balloon</em> (versus
      <em>the balloon was bright red</em>). Of course these hyphens
      are often omitted through ignorance anyway.
      </p>

      Come to think of it who needs punctuation anyway it s not as if
      we have commas and colons and semicolons appearing in the air
      around us as we speak unless you count the occasional sketching
      of quotation marks to indicate heavy handed irony so why should
      we bother marking off parenthetical remarks and subsidiary
      clauses and suchlike when we write ? I suppose it might be
      useful to retain question marks and perhaps end of sentence
      punctuation has a role to play although I rather fancy that if
      you actually transcribed people s speach patterns without trying
      to post rationalize some sort of gramatical structure you would
      end up deciding that most people speak one long sentence with
      endless repetitions and digressions from birth until death with
      the occasional pause for eating and sleeping Better still we can
      save 25% of the space needed for text b y o m i t t i n g t h o
