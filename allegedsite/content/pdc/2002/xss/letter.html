      <h1>Two suggestions for RSS 2.0</h1>
      <p>To: dave@userland.com, f8dy@diveintomark.org</p>
      <p>
        Two silly ideas for the next iteration of the Simple Syndication
        format.  My angle is as someone who (a)&nbsp;has hand-built
        site-maintenance tools that generate an <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/"><abbr title="Extensible Mark-up Language">XML</abbr></a> feed, and (b)&nbsp;started
        building my own <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr>&nbsp;0.9x consumer and discovered none of my <abbr title="Extensible-Stylesheet-Language Transform">XSLT</abbr> worked
        with <abbr title="RDF Site Summary">RSS</abbr>&nbsp;1.0...
      </p>
      <p>
        First, allow the container document to have an arbitrary root element,
        and make the <code>channel</code> wrapper optional as well.  Syndication
        processors <em class="ShouldMust">should </em> ignore everything apart from what in 0.92 documents
        are the subelements of <code>channel</code>.  The <code>item</code> elements must still
        follow all the others.  The <em>recommended</em> envelope for documents
        containing syndication data and nothing else remains as in 0.92 (apart
        from the version number):
      </p>
      <pre>
&lt;rss version="2.0" xmlns="http://my.netscape.com/rdf/simple/0.9/"&gt;
    &lt;channel&gt;...&lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;</pre>
      <p>
        For the sake of <abbr title="Extensible Mark-up Language">XML</abbr> fans, producers <em class="ShouldMust">should </em> generate the <code>xmlns</code>
        
        attribute as shown above.  Nevertheless, for compatibility, consumers
        <em class="ShouldMust">should </em> recognize syndication elements even if they appear
        unprefixed, even if in the wrong namespace (or with no namespace).
      </p>
      <p>
        The intention in removing the requirement for a particular envelope
        is that in the future syndication data can be embedded in <em>any</em> <abbr title="Extensible Mark-up Language">XML</abbr>
        document; in other words, syndication becomes a &lsquo;module&rsquo;
        that can be mixed in with other formats in any way that is convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, 0.9 documents are compatible with 2.0 consumers,
        because <code>item</code> elements are now permitted to follow the
        <code>channel</code> rather than be contained within it.  (I&nbsp;admit
        there are vanishingly few version-0.9 feeds left, so you may not care
        about this!)  I&nbsp;believe it also allows syndication data to be embedded
        in <abbr title="RDF Site Summary">RSS</abbr>&nbsp;1.0 documents (the <abbr title="Resource-Description Framework">RDF</abbr>-specific stuff being simply ignored),
        though I have not checked this thoroughly.  Some finessing may be
        required.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&rsquo;m pretty sure a form or words can be thrashed out that describes
        this slightly looser format without sacrificing the concise style of
        the existing <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr>&nbsp;0.9x documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, I would like to suggest using the name <abbr title="Extensible Mark-up Language">XML</abbr> Site Syndication
        (XSS) for this format.  At the same time we can start referring to the
        <abbr title="Resource-Description Framework">RDF</abbr>-based RSS as <abbr title="Resource-Description Framework">RDF</abbr>-<abbr title="Site Summary">SS</abbr> or <abbr title="Resource-Description Framework">RDF</abbr>/RSS.  The reason I want to do this is
        that&mdash;despite having many features in common&mdash;the two formats are
        different things, being the results of separate development processes,
        and it is confusing for outsiders that they have the same initials.
      </p>
      <p>
        For what it&rsquo;s worth, I think <a href="http://www.alleged.org.uk/pdc/2002/xss/"><abbr title="XML Site Syndication">XSS</abbr></a> is a nice name.  The
        <em>X</em> reminds us it is built on <abbr title="Extensible Mark-up Language">XML</abbr>, not on top of an <abbr title="Resource-Description Framework">RDF</abbr>
        layer on top of <abbr title="Extensible Mark-up Language">XML</abbr>.  Or, the <em>X</em> reminds us that the new
        format is now extensible because <abbr title="XML Site Syndication">XSS</abbr> documents can exploit modules
        defined separately (because of the namespace paragraph Dave already
        added).  You can pronounce it &lsquo;excesses&rsquo;, which gives it
        an attractively hedonistic flavour :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        I realize there are politics and history involved here, and that there
        are good reasons for not changing something&rsquo;s name (since name changes
        are also confusing).  On the other hand, I think having distinct names
        will make it easier to discuss differences and similarities between
        <abbr title="XML Site Syndication">XSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Resource-Description Framework">RDF</abbr>-<abbr title="Site Summary">SS</abbr> on a purely technical level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, that&rsquo;s my 2 ideas.  It may seem odd that on the one hand I am
        proposing a technical fix that just happens to make <abbr title="Resource-Description Framework">RDF</abbr>-<abbr title="Site Summary">SS</abbr> look like a
        special case of <abbr title="XML Site Syndication">XSS</abbr>, whereas on the other I am apparently cementing
        the fork by giving the different branches their own names.  But I
        really think that this will let us get back to the interesting bit
        (generating and consuming syndication data) and leave the discussion
        of the &lsquo;ownership&rsquo; of the RSS name to future historians...
      </p>
      <p>Bye for now</p>
