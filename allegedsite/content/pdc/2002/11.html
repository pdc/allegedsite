      <em>(Sunday night.)</em>
      Still nothing up for you to see yet, I’m afraid.  (Apart
      from anything else, I&nbsp;need to ask 
      <a href="http://www.humboldt.co.uk/">my host</a> to install a few
      Python packages...)  But I&nbsp;do do now have the start of the
      second CGI script, the one that accepts reader’s votes for
      the current round of pictures.  These votes later are used to
      decide which picture to use for that panel of the comic strip.
    </p>

    <p>
      At present the script accepts your vote but does not display
      them in any way.
      If you vote again, your previous ballot is silently overwritten.
      I&nbsp;plan 
      to support <a href="http://www.idhop.addr.com/av/">Approval
      Voting</a> in future by having a page where you have a checkbox
      for each candidate picture and can select as many as you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word ‘your’ is a little misleading; we use
      people’s IP addresses as their identifiers, which sort of
      works most of the time, but means that people sharing a proxy
      server will end up sharing a vote.  The alternative (requiring
      users to register in order to vote) is not likely to work
      because noone will want to register.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <em>Update (Monday night)</em>:
      The voting form now shows you the pictures with checkboxes.
      When you first visit the page, the picture you cloicked on is
      ticked, but then you can tick as many more as you like.  Because
      of the way HTML forms are processed, each form parameter is
      potentially a sequence anyway, so the code for each time around
      the voting form can be exactly  the same.  The code that adjusts
      the totals is very simple:
    </p>

    <pre>def vote(self, uid, pns):
    """Register a vote from the user identified by uid.

    uid is an integer, uniquely identifying a voter.
    pns is a list of picture numbers
    """
    oldPns = self.userVotes.get(uid, [])
    if pns == oldPns:
        return
    for pn in oldPns:
        self.pictures[pn].nVotes += -1
    for pn in pns:
        self.pictures[pn].nVotes += 1
    self.userVotes[uid] = pns</pre>

    <p>
      The first line retrieves that user’s old ballot, if any.
      The first <code>for</code> statement reverses the effect (if
      any) of their former vote, the second counts the new vote.  
      Finally the ‘ballot’ is saved for later.  Behind the
      scenes, <a href="http://zodb.sourceforge.net/"><abbr
      title="the Z Object Database">ZODB</abbr></a>
      takes care of reading the old data in off disc and 
      (when the transaction is committed) saving the updated
      data.
    </p>

    <p>
      My paid job involves writing a web application as well, except
      this one uses Microsoft <abbr title="Active Server
      Pages">ASP</abbr>&nbsp;.Net linked via <abbr title="Active Data
      Objects">ADO</abbr>&nbsp;.Net to Microsoft <abbr
      title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr>
      Server&reg;&nbsp;2000.  To do a similar job to the above
      snippet, I&nbsp;would be writing two <abbr title="Structured
      Query Language">SQL</abbr> stored procedures (one to retrieve
      the exisiting ballot, one to alter the ballot).  Invoking a
      stored procedure is several more lines of code in the <abbr
      title="C Sharp">C&#x266F;</abbr> or <abbr title="Microsoft
      Visual Basic">VB</abbr>&nbsp;.Net layer as you create a Command
      object, add parameters to it, execute it, and dispose of the
      remains.  (Or you can create DataSet objects which are even
      worse, but have specialized wizards to help you draft the code.)
      The actual algorithm (the encoding of the business logic) would
      be buried in dozens of lines of boilerplate.  By comparison, the Python+<abbr
      title="the Z Object Database">ZODB</abbr> implementation is a
      miracle of concision and clarity.  The
      <a href="http://www.zope.org/"><abbr title="Z Object Programming
      Environment">ZOPE</abbr></a> people deserve much kudos.

      Even in a toy web application like the Picky Picky Game, it is
      possible (but unlikely) that two people will want to upload a
      picture at (nearly) the exact same moment.  If two processes try

      I&nbsp;throught I’d try out a different CGI framework, such
      as <a href="http://jonpy.sourceforge.net/">jonpy</a>, and this
      requires Python 2.2.  So I&nbsp;have now installed
      Python&nbsp;2.2 (carefully installing GNU db, expat, etc. first
      so these modules will be built).  During its self-tests,
      I&nbsp;noticed that <code>test_socket.py</code> takes 2&frac12;
      minutes (to do something that should take approximately no
      time).  Come to think of it, initiating connections to my Linux
      box from Jeremy’s <abbr title="Microsoft Windows
      NT">NT</abbr> box also takes an inordinate amount of time.  That
      might be why initiating HTTP connections to my
      <code>thttpd</code> instance also takes an inordinate amount of
      time, so long that <code>thttpd</code> kills the CGI rather than
      waste any more time.  In other words, my CGI problems may mostly
      stem from a broken network stack.  Teriffic.  This is a
      variation on <a
      href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html">Joel
      Spolsky’s law of leaky abstractions</a>: I would like to
      be able to believe in POSIX’s abstraction of sockets as
      being a lot like a file, but sadly it is all frinked up.
      Another reason to spend a week or two installing <a
      href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&nbsp;think the way forward for now is probably to ignore the
      network problems and cross my fingers when I&nbsp;install it on
      the actual server.  Given that fairly thorough search of the WWW
      and Netnews reveals no discussion of the sort of problems
      I’ve been having, I&nbsp;am fairly sure it is some
      freakish glitch in my computer...

      Judging from their behaviour, it has long seemed that the powers
      that be in Oxfordshire hold cyclists in contempt but don’t
      feel able to actually come out and admit it.  One of their
      techniques for discouraging cycle commuters is to make it as
      difficult to park a bicycle in town as it is to park a car.
      Case in point: up until yesterday, I had the perfect place to
      park <a href="../2002/../bike/">my bicycle</a>
      each work day—it had a roof overhead and
      plenty of railings to lock my machine to, and was not in
      anybody’s way.  The <a
      href="http://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk">County Council</a> (in
      whose car park this spot was) has now fenced off this area with
      a big steel fence, with a notice to the effect that it was
      reserved for Environmental Services’ motorbikes and
      bicycles.  When I&nbsp;tried locking my bike to the outside of
      the new cage, notices were put up ordering me not to (the
      implication being that they would not mind damaging my bike in
      the process of removing it).
    </p>
    <p>
      The upshot of this is that there is nowhere to park near my
      office.  All the road signs are already occupied by the time
      I&nbsp;get in. The foyer already has three bikes in it, but
      I&nbsp;would not have used it anyway, having already had a bike
      stolen from such a situation.  In the end I&nbsp;locked it to
      the back of a street sign in the next street along.
      Psychologically it feels exposed out there in the middle of the
      footpath.  I&nbsp;much preferred keeping it out of
      people’s way, on the grounds they will then feel less need
      to vandalize it&hellip;

      It occurs to me I&nbsp;may be being harsh on Opera;
      I&nbsp;notice that elsewhere they show a preference for
      splitting MIME parameters over multiple physical lines.  For
      example, they use

      On <a href="../2002/11.html#e20021111">Monday</a> I&nbsp;was troubled by
      <code>EAGAIN</code> interruptions when reading in a CGI
      script’s data.  It turns out Python has a <code>cgi</code>
      module already.  But when I&nbsp;tried creating a script that
      used that, it failed to work with <a
      href="../2002/11.html#e20021108">Opera’s boundary-less
      multipart</a> (the built-in <code>cgi</code> module uses the
      <code>multifile</code>, which I&nbsp;tried and rejected
      earlier).
    </p>
    <p>
      I&nbsp;have tried looping until <code>EAGAIN</code> does not
      happen—but I&nbsp;put a limit of 10 iterations so as not
      to chew up the CPU.  No dice.  I&nbsp;have also tried using the
      <code>fcntl</code> module to remove the <code>O_NONBLOCK</code>
      flag from stdin.  The result is that instead of crashing with
      <code>EAGAIN</code> it waits indefinitely (and gets interrupted
      by <code>thttpd</code>’s watchdog timer).
    </p>
    <p>
      The upshot of this is that I&nbsp;have the beginnings of a CGI
      script that works if I&nbsp;connect to it from the same machine the
      server is running on, but not if I&nbsp;connect to it from a
      different machine (an NT box) on the same network.
      The thing is, I&nbsp;<em>know</em> that people have successfully
      written CGI programs in Python, and none of the examples
      I&nbsp;find on-line have any mention of these phenomena.

      I have now written a parser for HTML-4.0 file uploads (forms

      Opera&nbsp;5 omits the boundary parameter when uploading files.
      Lynx&nbsp;2.8.2 does not support uploading files at all (but,
      oddly, does generate <code>multipart/form-data</code> forms
      properly—it even gives the <code>charset</code> parameter
      to the content-type of its form items).  Python’s
      <code>multifile</code> module raises an exception on all of the
      above, for some inputs.

      I guess that if I want to handle uploaded images, I&nbsp;get to

      Found some time to continue <a href="../2002/10.html#e20021031">work on
      the Picky Picky Game</a>.  I&nbsp;have something which, given a
      graphics file, writes it in to the correct place in the
      directory structure.  Tonight’s task was a routine for
      generating the index page, based on the pictures stored so far.
      In the eventual web application, this routine will be invoked in
      <abbr title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</abbr> scripts
      whenever a new picture is added or vote recorded.  For the
      present I&nbsp;can just run the Python script (one of the ways
      in which creating web apps in Python is less hassle than, say,
      <abbr title="Microsoft&reg; ActiveX Server
      Pages">ASP</abbr>&nbsp;.Net or <a
      href="../2002/../wp/wc.html">webclasses</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The index page format is mainly controlled through a
      ‘skin’ file <code>index.skin</code>.  This has most
      of the HTML, with special XML tags for interpolating the dynamic
      content.  This way hopefully Jeremy will be able to hack the
      HTML without touching any of the application code.  (The
      immediate inspiration for the term <em>skin</em> comes from the
      <a href="http://helma.org/">Helma Object Publisher</a> system,
      which does something similar, but using JavaScript.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture metadata is written in <abbr title="Extensible
      Mark-up Language">XML</abbr> which is straight&shy;forward
      enough except that Python’s native 
      <abbr title="Simple API for XML">SAX</abbr> support is broken:
      it does not support <abbr title="Extensible
      Mark-up Language">XML</abbr> namespaces!  I&nbsp;have fixed this
      with my own  <abbr title="Simple API for XML">SAX</abbr> filter
      dubbed <code>SaxLifter</code>: it processes
      <code>startElement</code> events by scanning the attributes for
      namespace prefixes, maintaining a stack of namespace mappings,
      and generating <code>startElementNS</code> events.  Presumably
      if I&nbsp;were using the XML-SIG or 4Thought enhancements to
      Python things would work better.  Sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The overall strategy is to generate as much static HTML as
      possible—that is, instead of creating the HTML for the
      list of pictures afresh each time someone visits the site (which
      is what PHP and ASP, etc., do), I&nbsp;intend to generate it
      only when a new picture is added to the list.  Since adding
      pictures will happen much more rarely than viewing the list,
      this reduces the overall load on the web server.  The aim is to
      use <abbr title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</abbr> only in
      the pages that make a change (adding a picture or voting).

      We spent Sunday in London.  First to see <cite>Marsyas</cite>,
      <a
      href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/kapoor/">Anish
      Kapoor’s giant red sculpture in the Tate Modern</a>
      (<a
      href="http://www.unilever.co.uk/news/anishkapoor.html">this year’s
      Unilever Series installation</a>).  As <a
      href="http://peteashton.com/001058.html">Pete</a> points out, it
      is very big, designed to look like it had to be positively
      rammed in to the Turbine Hall and almost didn’t fit.  The
      title suggests that it is (part of) the flayed skin of a
      mythological figure, represented in Jack Kirby style as a
      titanic giant.
    </p>

    <p>
      We only stayed a moment, because we were really there to see the
      <a
      href="http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/turnerprize/">Turner
      Prize exhibits</a> at the <a
      href="http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/">Tate Britain</a>.  The
      place has been extensively remodelled since we last
      visited—even the route from the tube stop to the entrance
      was different—using similar white creamy stone to the
      British Museum refit.  Jeremy and I liked the Turner Prize
      stuff.  
    </p>

    <p>
      I&nbsp;really liked <a
      href="http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/turnerprize/2002/tyson.htm">Keith
      Tyson</a>’s collection of poster-sized sketches of crazy
      ideas and images.  (One of the complaints people were making in
      the comments room was that modern artists cannot draw.  This is
      patently not the case Keith Tyson’s idea-posters.)  His
      three-dimensional works start in poster form—in this case
      he had the diagram for <cite>The Thinker (After Rodin)</cite>
      and the sculpture itself in the same room.  His
      <cite>Thinker</cite> is sort of the reverse of Rodin’s:
      instead of representing the <em>appearance</em> of a person
      thinking, it does something that represents the thinking itself:
      there is a computer system inside the column running a virtual
      world simulation.  If you put your ear to the column you can
      hear its ‘thoughts’.
    </p>

    <p>
      To round off the cultural evening we watched the low-budget
      British post-apocalyptic movie <a
      href="http://uk.imdb.com/Details?0289043"><cite>28 Days
      Later</cite></a>.  Afterwards as we walked home we passed some
      of the landmarks from the deserted London of the film...
