      I&nbsp;had an idle thought about using topic-maps’
      processing model (or even topic maps themselves) to represent
      the information encoded in <abbr title="Really Simple
      Syndication">RSS</abbr> and <abbr title="RDF Site
      Summary">RSS</abbr> data resources.  The attraction is that
      topic maps have a concept of merging built in, so writing an
      aggregator would in principle be straightforward.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Obviously stories are topics, and categories are topics.  What
      about dates?  These become what in topic-maps are called
      occurences (the concept of occurrence is stretched a little).
      I&nbsp;assume any topic-map query-engine is willing to do
      grouping and sorting on  topics according to occurrence values?
    </p>

    <p>
      This got me thinking about dates in metadata.  Most metadata
      examples I’ve seen use what might be called free-form
      dates.  This is perhaps OK within one, isolated database, but
      when I&nbsp;am merging two topic-maps, how does my
      computer&nbsp;know how to compare dates in random formats like
      <code>13 Oct 02</code> and <code>2002-09-22</code>?  I&nbsp;would
      rather not rely on the cute guessing games that programs like
      Microsoft&reg; Excel resort to (e.g., if I&nbsp;enter 12-09-2002
      and 13-09-2002 in separate cells, they end up holding
      9&nbsp;December and 13&nbsp;September).
    </p>

    <p>
      My suggestion is that the occurrence-types that subclass special
      topics that are conventionally used for dates in particular
      formats.  These special topics in turn would require published
      subject indicators.  I&nbsp;have created a page that contains <a
      href="../2002/../../2002/datetime.html">PSIs for Date-Time occurrence
      types</a> to illustrate the idea.  Note! this is just for
      discussion.  Also, it really needs an attached
      machine-processable metadata resource (in <abbr title="XML Topic
      Map">XTM</abbr>, say).
    </p>

    <p>
      Another slightly weird approach would be to reify the dates.
      That is, create topics representing the dates themselves.  The
      relationship between story and the date it is published on then
      is represented as an association between the story topic and the
      date topic.  Date topics would use PSIs with a format like
      <code>http://psi.example.com/2002/date/#2002-09-22</code> or
      <code>http://psi.example.com/2002/date/?d=2002-09-22</code> (the
      latter has the advantage of being able to run a check on the
      format of its param).  Probably less efficient than using occurences.

      My network at home uses what is now old-fashioned coax with BNC
      connectors.  New computers—such as, for example, a
      visiting iBooks—only have connectors for new-style cat-5e
      cables.  Rather than replace my entire home network, I’m
      experimenting with a second
      <abbr title="Network Interface Card">NIC</abbr> and a crossover
      cable.  This means powering down my desktop (uptime: up 170
      days, 15:55).  
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Update:</em>
      some hours later I&nbsp;have managed to get my <em>first</em>
      card working again, after Red Hat’s auto-configuration
      clobbered my settings!  My attempts to load the module for
      card #2 so far unsuccessful.  I have downloaded a newer kernel
      (I&nbsp;was running 2.2.12, this is 2.2.22),
      which is currently compiling.  Maybe it will do better.
      &para; It has now finished after 15&frac12; minutes.
      I&nbsp;will not try rebooting until tomorrow, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Update (Sunday):</em>
      Turns out that kernel 2.2.22 hangs on boot-up.  Argh.
      Returned to 2.2.12 for now.
      On the
      otherhand, I&nbsp;discovered that <code>make modules
      modules_install</code> is different from merely <code>make
      modules_install</code>.  It appears that the install target does
      not imply actually building the modules?  Anyway, I&nbsp;did
      this and I&nbsp;now have an <code>rtl2039.o</code> that can be
      loaded with <code>modprobe</code>.  Alas! trying to bring up the
      interface complains of a ‘Resource temporarily
      unavailable’, which I&nbsp;take to mean that the card
      needs to have an <abbr title="interrupt request">IRQ</abbr>
      assigned to it, something that may be doable through the BIOS?
      Something to try later in the week.
      I&nbsp;have other things to do today.

      I’ve been <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/09/11/topicmaps.html">reading</a> about 
      <a href="http://www.topicmaps.org/">Topic Maps</a>,
      an 
      <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>
      standard that has been augmented with an 
      <a href="http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/">XML
      representation</a>.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Topic maps are very similar to the <abbr
      title="Resource-Description Framework">RDF</abbr>, in that they
      are all about graphs of topics (representing real-world
      subjects) connected with associations.  The difference is that
      the Topic-maps paradigm seems easier to understand.  Maybe its
      because they draw a distinction between the topics and the
      subjects they stand in for, whereas <abbr
      title="Resource-Description Framework">RDF</abbr> tends to
      conflate the two.  Or maybe its the way a few important
      relationships (like occurence and instanceOf) are treated
      specially in topic maps, which makes maps a little less
      bewilderingly generic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Topic maps have a system of using 
      <abbr title="Universal Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s 
      to stand in for particular abstract subjects.
      Separate topic maps using the same URI
      <code>http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/language.xtm#en</code>
      as the <em>subject indicator</em> for the English language
      know they are referring to the same thing.
      When they are merged, the corresponding topics will be combined
      automatically.  One of the activities of various topic-map
      committees is creating <em>published</em> subject indicators for
      various generically useful types of topic, in order to promote
      interoperability between topic maps.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Other (meta)data systems use URIs to represent subjects: 
      <abbr
      title="Resource-Description Framework">RDF</abbr> does (using a
      weird convention where XML element-names turn in to URIs), 
      <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> 0.9x/2.0 does
      (inasmuch as <code>category</code> names may be  interpreted
      relative to a <code>domain</code> specified by a URL).  It would
      be kind of cool if we could all agree to use the same 
      subject identifiers, so our various efforts interoperate as much
      as possible.

	  <td>2.0</td>
	</tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      In my opinion, it is a grave mistake to include a version number
      in a namespace URI.  The function of a namespace is to prevent
      accidental collisions between names defined by different people
      (or organizations) when two XML vocabularies are combined in one
      document.  The version number of the format can be specified 
      separately (as indeed all the RSS versions do, as an attribute
      of their root element).  If the 0.9 spec had only used
      <code>http://netscape.com/1999/rss</code> as its namespace
      (following the lead of
      <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>) then all
      the versions could have used the same namespace.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why do I&nbsp;care, you ask?  Because if you use actual XML
      tools like XSLT to manipulate RSS feeds, then the fact that
      there are three or four namespaces in use for essentially the
      same elements makes the whole thing more complicated.  Where
      I&nbsp;might have had
    </p>

    <pre>&lt;xsl:template match="/rss:rss/rss:channel"&gt;...</pre>

    <p>
      I better be prepared for more complicated expressions like
    </p>

    <pre>&lt;xsl:template match="/*/*[lname()=channel]"&gt;...</pre>

    <p>
      (to allow for any root element, and  to ignore the namespace of
      the <code>channel</code> element).  This clutters the XSLT file
      and makes it harder to maintain—and probably also less
      efficient.  Sigh.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not unique to RSS, by the way—I&nbsp;had all sorts
      of hassle with early ve4sions of SVG tools which were caught out
      by the ever-changing SVG namespace URL.  They finally settled on
      the quite-sane <code>http://www.w3.org/2000/svg</code>.

      It is also the

      shiny-new Australian commonwealth (3 September 1901).
      As it happens, when it came to making up quizzes for some

      flag as a topic, which meant I ended up
