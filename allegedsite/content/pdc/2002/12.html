      My <a href="../2002/../tarot/">Alleged Tarot 2002</a> project has been
      stuck with an ersatz dealer for far too long (since

      now added to the <a href="../2002/../tarot/aboutDealer.html">JavaScript

      to a seed number, rather than requiring the querent to supply

      Yesterday (the 23rd) we made a point of waiting for the post to
      arrive before going in to work, but to no avail.  When we
      returned home we found yet another of those cards telling us a
      parcel was waiting for us at the depot in Sandy Lane West.
      Since I&nbsp;was taking a day’s holiday on Christmas Eve,
      I&nbsp;set off to pick up the parcel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cycling to the depot would be straightforward enough if it had
      occurred to anyone to add a few directional signs along the
      route.  You start by cycling up Cowley Road past Temple Cowley.
      This is a steeper climb than I remembered, and I&nbsp;soon got
      very hot.  The intersection at Temple Cowley is a little
      intimidating—in order to get to the off-road cycle lane
      you have to move in to the middle lane (since the left lane is
      left-turn-only).  The off-road path takes you to the Ring Road
      roundabout, and crossing the road on foot takes you to the
      cycle+dog path that parallels the Ring Road.  This is an ideal
      shared cycle path: broad, flat, and only sparsely populated with
      pedestrians.  The first left would be Tesco’s megamart.
      Skipping that you come to a confusing dip-under-the-road
      junction with something labelled Barns Road.  You need to go up
      on to this main road and thereby cross the Ring Road.  Another
      off-road cycle path now appears, but ignore it; it is leading
      you away from a mini-roundabout which you want to use to turn
      right on to Sandy Lane West.  The home stretch!  The trick here
      is to <em>not</em> look out for the <s>Royal Mail</s> Consignia
      sign, because all you will find at the Reception window there is
      a hand-written sign telling you to go back two places to the
      Nuffield Industrial Estate.  Once you go down there the
      Enquiries office is reasonably well signposted.  Annoyingly
      there is nowhere to park a bicycle.  (This is Oxford, after
      all!)
    </p>
    <p>
      Even more annoyingly, there was also a piece of paper in the
      window saying they were closing the office an hour an a half
      early today.  So the journey was all for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could they have prevented this?  Yes, by telling me the modified
      office hours on the card they stuck through my letter box.  This
      card is completely generic, probably printed in the millions at
      some central printers.  Too bad they don’t produce a local
      version for each Post Town so they can have the address printed
      on them (we have received these cards with no address on at all
      in the past).  Too bad they don’t have a special Xmas
      Season version of the card giving their reduced opening times.
      Given that December must account for a disproportionately large
      fraction of displaced domestic parcels (as opposed to parcels
      for business addresses), this would seem a logical measure to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, is it worth fucking over people like me for
      the sake of a measly hour and a half extra holiday?  Surely that
      office needs at most two people present (one customer-facing,
      one fetching parcels), so paying them enormous overtime would
      not break the bank, right?

      In the process of getting the <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/interface.html"><abbr title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</abbr></a> scripts to work again after
      reorganizing the libraries, I have further refactored them my
      moving the request-processing code in to the Picky Picky Game
      library, leaving the <abbr title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</abbr> script to contain just a few
      configuration parameters and an invocation of the library
      routine.  This style is not unlike that used by Joe Gregorio in
      his <a
      href="http://wellformedweb.org/RESTLog.cgi/14">Well-Formed

    <p>
      There are various advantages to moving most
      of the code out of the <abbr title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</abbr>s themsevles—better information
      hiding, for example (which can be considered a security feature
      as well as good programming practice).  It also allows the bulk
      of the code to be stored in byte-compiled form on disc, which
      might make processing requests a little faster.

      Spent another dollop of time on the Picky Picky Game, moving
      code in to my <code>www</code> module.  This is a slow process
      because I&nbsp;have decided that this module is going to have a
      complete set of unit tests (<code>wwwtests.py</code>).  Writing
      tests after the fact can be a little depressing—it keeps
      digging up bugs (i.e., mistakes) you made when writing the
      function in the first place.  The Extreme Programming gurus say
      this is why <a
      href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CodeUnitTestFirst">writing the
      tests first</a> is psychologically important (as well as being
      important to their methodology) because you end the day
      successfully passing tests that failed earlier in the day,
      rather than not depressingly writing tests that either never get
      triggered or which show up flaws in your precious code.

    <p>
      Anyway, the upshot of today’s not particularly intensive
      work is that it does more or less what it did last week, but is
      maybe a bit more reliable than it was before.

      Last night I hacked the code that generates the archive web
      pages for my weblog (or whatever it is this site is) so that the
      headings of the supplementary articles also have link anchors.
      In the process I broke my RSS feed slightly—it got
      confused by the <code>id</code> tags.  (while remaining

      I’have had a Palm&nbsp;3 for some time 
      (creaky old 2-MB model).  I&nbsp;used to say that when I&nbsp;upgraded
      it, I&nbsp;wanted that to be next upgrade for my phone, as
      well.  That product now exists in the form of 
      the <a
      href="http://www.handspring.com/products/treo/index.jhtml?sub_nav_section=Overview&prod_cat_name=Treo"><img src="../2002/treo-180g.jpg" align="right" alt="" width="82" height="100"/>Handspring
      Treo</a>, a compact palmtop with a phone built in, and 
      <a
      href="http://www.livejournal.com/talkpost.bml?journal=tinyjo&itemid=153451">Jo
      has one</a>.  Sadly Handspring don’t consider Grafitti an
      asset in a device aimed at non-Palm-users, so the 180g has
      already been air-brushed out of history in favour of its
      keyboard-sporting cousin.  The problem is the Treo does cost
      rather a lot more than, say, Adrian’s entry-level <a
      href="http://sonyelectronics.sonystyle.com/micros/clie/models/sl10.html"><img
      src="http://sonyelectronics.sonystyle.com/micros/clie/media/home-sl10.jpg"
      align="left" alt="" width="80" height="157" />Sony
      Cli&eacute;</a>, which is similarly compact and has a high-res
      screen.  I really don’t know which I&nbsp;would prefer as
      the successor to my clunky old Palm&nbsp;3.
    </p>

    <p>
      Actually the fact is I&nbsp;don’t need to replace my
      disfunctional old  Palm&nbsp;3;
      I&nbsp;frankly don’t use very much, not the way <a
      href="http://tinyjo.net/">Jo</a> and <a
      href="../2002/../../jrd/">Jeremy</a> use theirs.  
      Its main failing is not its memory size but its
      size—justa little bit bigger than pocket sized (unlike
      both the Cli&eacute; and the Treo).
      I&nbsp;have admitedly
      upgraded my Alcatel Max DB phone (the same model that <a
      href="http://mpt.phrasewise.com/2002/11/28#a398">caused mpt so
      much confusion</a>) for its smaller successor the 311, but that
      is still one of Virgin’s cheapest handsets and I&nbsp;only
      rarely use the thing.  I&nbsp;have absolutely no need to upgrade
      either of them.  Annoyingly.

      Up until today my <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr>
      feed has had one link per day, even though there might be extra
      (supplementary) articles on that day.  
      If you look at the HTML page, the first article of the day
      gets the big heading with the date and suchlike, and the 
      subsequent articlettes get smaller headings.  Up until now the
      smaller articles were omitted from the RSS.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have now tweaked the program that generates it so that these
      smaller headings also get links in the RSS data.  At the moment
      they link to their parent item; this will change once I&nbsp;add
      HTML anchors to the headings so that they can link direct to
      those.  Sorry for any inconvenience.

      Having got the first working version of the Picky Picky Game,
      I&nbsp;have naturally now pulled it apart again.  I&nbsp;decided
      that now  it is in a state where it makes sense to try to
      package up a version for Adrian to try installing, I&nbsp;better
      think about getting the module and package names right, since it
      will be harder to change them later.  
    </p>

    <p>
      I&nbsp;have reorganized my Python classes in to their own
      package <code>pdc</code> (designed to prevent name collisions
      with WWW-oriented packages by other people).  I&nbsp;also
      changed some of the file names—so that ‘<code>import
      httputils</code>’ becomes ‘<code>from pdc import
      www</code>’.  
    </p>

    <p>
      There is now a proper 
      <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UnitTest">unit-test</a>
      suite for  the <code>www</code>
      module (which has functions like <code>urlDecode</code>, 
      <code>urlResolve</code>, and <code>xmlencode</code>).  This is
      easier to do for this odule than the others, which tend to
      involve creating scads of HTML text which will be hard to check
      for errors.  For the URL-manipulating functions, the unit tests
      turned out to be invaluable—there are a lot of corner
      cases that I&nbsp;only sorted out because I&nbsp;had tests for
      all of them.
