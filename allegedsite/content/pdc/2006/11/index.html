<div><img src="../../2006/../wp/icon-64x64.png" alt="" align="left" width="64" height="64" border="0" /></div><p class="first">Web servers started as a solution to getting information from other sites. Then
   it became convenient to use HTML and HTTP on one’s local-area network, and for
   some reason we had to call that idea an ‘intranet’ to make people pay attention.
   Sometimes it is useful to run a mini-server on the same computer as your desktop
   application; in this note I’ll discuss this idea in the context of an
   application written to Microsoft’s .Net platform, since that’s what we use at
   work.
</p>

<h2> Desktop web servers</h2>
<div>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pdc/269431464/" title="Rachel and a Quilted Wall Hanging"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/83/269431464_a248a84e72_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="" align="left" /></a>
</div>

<p>The idea of running a web server locally is not new.<br/><a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a> used this
   technique in <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio Userland</a> something like ten years ago: you run a web
   server on the user’s desktop, and the user-interface of the program runs as HTML
   in their favourite web browser.  When the application is about building weblogs,
   it makes some sense to hand over the job of displaying HTML to the web browser,
   rather than trying to develop your own.
</p>
<p>Depending on your operating system, presenting your UI in HTML does not even
   mean it has to look like it is running in a web browser if you don’t want it to.
   On Microsoft Windows, you can turn your HTML page in to a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/hta/overview/htaoverview.asp">HTML Application</a>
   (HTA) by changing the file name to end in <code>.hta</code>; if you have installed
   Microsoft .Net Framework or Microsoft SQL Server 2005 recently, you will have
   seen an HTA in action: the installer front-end is implemented as HTML in this
   way. On the Mac, the closest equivalent is <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/">Dashboard</a> widgets. Another
   possibility is to have your application use an embedded web-browser as part of
   its UI.
</p>
<p>Obviously the performance requirements for a desktop web server are different
   from one used to field requests from all over the internet. This means that the
   footprint of the server can be much smaller: it does not need a farm of worker
   processes to be set up, or eleborate support for caching or esoteric HTTP
   headers or multi-layered security. Well-known, ‘industrial-strength’ web servers
   like Apache and Microsoft IIS are too heavyweight for this niche: you want a
   server that can scale <em>down</em> not scale <em>up</em>.
</p>

<h2> Why use a Desktop Web Server in .Net?</h2>
<div>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pdc/289477192/" title="The EndÑOr Just the Beginning?"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/118/289477192_cffc8cefd5_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="" align="right" /></a>
</div>

<p>Without going in to details (for reasons of client confidentiality), I think I
   can admit to working on a desktop application using Microsoft .Net and its
   WinForms class library. We want to allow users to add comments to things in the
   program which for this article I shall call boojums; the customer wants threaded
   bulletin-board-style comments. While it would be possible to display indented,
   hierarchical comment lists with WinForms widgets, it is easier to see how to do
   this in HTML (<a href="http://www.geekswithblogs.net/tscott/archive/2005/06/07/42506.aspx">WinForms is already obsolete</a>, so learning how to do it in
   Winforms would be a waste of time).
</p>
<p>We already display some other info via an embedded browser window. For our
   existing use of the browser control, we simply supply a static HTML file for it
   to display (this involves making lots of temporary files). For the comments, I
   will need users to be able to click on comments to show and hide them, and also
   a way to reply to a particular comment. For this I want a mechanism for the
   JavaScript running in the HTML to talk to the host application; rather than work out how
   to install a new protocol (which is how Microsoft solved this for the Books
   Online used in Microsoft Visual Bedsit Apartment Workshop .NET Solution Suite
   2003), it seemed more straightforward to run a desktop web server for the HTML
   in the comments view to talk to.
</p>
<p>The trick is that the .Net worldview is all about web servers being big, in
   fact, so far as .Net is concerned there is only one web server, IIS, and only
   one way to write web pages, ASP.NET, both of which are far to clunky to stick on
   the side of a desktop app. So I have to roll my own. This is the opposite of the
   situation with Python, which is so eager to <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Why_so_many_Python_web_frameworks" title="Why so many Python web frameworks? (Bitworking)">make making web servers easy</a>,
   people complain there are <em>too many</em> web frameworks!
</p>

<h2> Adapting WSGI for .Net</h2>
<div>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pdc/289477198/" title="Christmas Baubles for Giants"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/103/289477198_f2782cd766_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Christmas Baubles for Giants" align="left" /></a>
</div>

<p>You could spend ages designing a web server, and working out how to divide it in
   to self-contained chunks that can be tested independently (I definitely do not
   want to debugging of the web server to be mixed in with running the GUI
   application). To save time, I decided to start by adapting the simplest
   web-server API I know of: Python’s <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/" title="PEP 333 Python Web Server Gateway Interface v1.0">WSGI</a> (Web-server gateway interface). This
   is interesting because WSGI exploits Python’s flexibility to define an interface
   using no class definitions at all: your web application is not a class or a
   swarm of classes, but a single callable object (a function, or a method on a
   class instance, or an object that pretends to be a function by implementing a
   method named <code>__call__</code>), and the web server exposes its functionality as a
   dictionary and another callable. In .Net I use delegates where Python uses
   callables (I could have used interfaces with a single member to similar effect).
</p>
<p>Thus we have a division of labour that goes like this. The application-specific
   ‘top half’ of the server is a function that matches this signature:
</p>
<pre><code>public delegate IEnumerable HandleRequestDelegate(
    IDictionary environ,
    StartResponseDelegate startResponse);
</code></pre><p>where <code>environ</code> has entries like <code>PATH_INFO</code> and <code>REQUEST_METHOD</code> based on the
   CGI conventions, and <code>startResponse</code> is a function supplied by the
   application-ignorant, HTTP-savvy ‘lower half’, and has this signature:
</p>
<pre><code>public delegate void StartResponseDelegate(
    string status, IList headers);
</code></pre><p>The handler function examines <code>environ</code> to get the information about the
   request. It then calls <code>startResponse</code> to begin its response, supplying the
   headers for the HTTP response as an <code>IList</code> of <code>DictionaryEntry</code> objects (this
   is the closest I could find to an equivalent of WSGI’s list of tuples; I wonder
   if an <code>IDictionary</code> might have done just as well). The result of the function is
   an <code>IEnumerable</code> that returns zero or more chunks of the body of the response.
   These chunks can be strings (which are always encoded as UTF-8 in my server) or
   byte arrays.
</p>
<p>A simple request-handler function would look like this:
</p>
<pre><code>private IEnumerable HandleRequest(IDictionary environ, StartResponseDelegate startResponse) {
    ArrayList headers = new ArrayList();
    headers.Add(new DictionaryEntry("Content-Type", "text/plain; charset=UTF-8"));
    startResponse("200 OK", headers);
    return new string[]{"Hello, World!"};
}
</code></pre><p>This is the direct adaptation of the corrsponding Python WSGI code:
</p>
<pre><code>def handle_request(environ, start_response):
    headers = [(’Content-type’,’text/plain; charset=UTF-8’)]
    start_response(’200 OK’, headers)
    return [’Hello, World!’]
</code></pre><p>You now create the server and start it up like this:
</p>
<pre><code>InProcWebServer server = new InProcWebServer(
        new HandleRequestDelegate(HandleRequest));
server.Start();
Uri baseUri = server.BaseUri;
</code></pre><p>The <code>BaseUri</code> property is something like <code>http://127.0.0.1:2134/</code>, and is used
   to generate URLs that talk to the new server. Because the hostname is
   <code>127.0.0.1</code>, only processes running on this computer can connect to the server.
   The port number 2134 is generated by the operating system, and is different each
   time you run the program.
</p>
<p>This leaves me with two tasks:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><p>Write the bottom half: the web server, which listens for requests, parses them to create the<br/><code>environ</code> disctionary, and then calls the handle-request function; and
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Write the top half: a method on the application object that implements the handle-request
     function. 
</p>

 </li>
</ul>
<p>  function. 
</p>
<p>The web server part is (at least in principle) reusable in other projects.
</p>

<h2> Writing the lower half</h2>
<div>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pdc/294548590/" title="Sparkler Squiggle"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/105/294548590_003e363c34_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="" align="right" /></a>
</div>

<p>The first few unit tests use <code>WebRequest</code> and <code>WebResponse</code> classes to talk to
   the HTTP server. Since this trivial web application does not look at the
   <code>environ</code> parameter, I was able to write the first unit tests that tested the
   server threading without having to write the entire HTTP parser in one go.
</p>
<p>This was the first time I’d needed to investigate the .Net class library’s
   networking classes. They supply a <code>Socket</code> class that does all the things that a
   Unix programmer from the 1990s would expect. They also have a wrapper
   <code>TclListener</code> that does bind, listen, accept for you. The greatest difficulty
   was in guessing the class name of the synchronization object I would need to
   co-ordinate server (background) thead with the caller: <code>AutoResetEvent</code>, as it
   turned out.
</p>
<p>The reason I need to synchronize the two threads is that the socket for the
   server is created without specifying a port number: the system supplies a random
   unused port. So my calling thread—which needs to know the port number—has to
   be suspended long enough for the <code>TcpListener</code> to be created and ready to
   divulge this piece of information.
</p>
<p>After that, the server thread starts a loop along the lines of
</p>
<pre><code>for (;;) {
    TcpClient client = listener.AcceptTcpClient();
    if (state == State.Stopping) {
        break;
    }
    Thread thread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(
            new Acceptor(client).Run));
    thread.IsBackground = true;
    thread.Start();
}
</code></pre><p>I then define an inner class <code>Acceptor</code> that basically does nothing except
   provide one method—<code>Run</code>—and a place to store its one variable, the client.
   The method <code>Acceptor.Run</code> handles one HTTP request, issues the response, and
   then quietly terminates.
</p>
<p>The next step is easier if you have two monitors. You display a copy of <a href="../../2006/rfc
2616" title="rfc
2616">RFC
2616</a> (or the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">W3C’s sectionized version</a>) on one screen and your
   development editor in the other. I mentioned earlier that you can write the
   first few unit tests so they only need you to parse the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html#sec5.1">Request-Line (section
5.1)</a>, leaving the message headers for later.
</p>
<p>When parsing the incoming stream, I wrote the code to work byte by byte,
   taking care not to copy character data in to  in a <code>StringBuilder</code> until after byte stream had been
   passed through my scanner. The point to this is that the syntax of HTTP requests
   is defined in terms of bytes (or octets), for which ASCII is a convenient
   representation, and <em>not</em> character strings (which in .Net are something
   different). I also did not want to risk .Net being to clever about line-endings
   and confusing matters. This is particularly pertinent when parsing the
   <em>message-header</em>s, where you might think you can just use the built-in
   <code>ReadLine</code> routine, but then get confused over splicing in continuation lines and
   not eating the whitespace at the start of the message body. To get it right, read the RFC and
   draw yourself a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_state_machine">finite state machine</a> on a piece of paper, that’s my advice.
</p>
<p>After that you need to call the <code>HandleRequestDelegate</code>, and then pump out the
   headers and body content to the socket stream, and the server’s job is done.
</p>

<h2> Developing the top half</h2>
<div>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pdc/294548571/" title="Green Fountain"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/117/294548571_482f9233d5_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="" align="left" /></a>
</div>

<p>The other side of the fence is the top half, the bit which knows about the
   application. The neat thing about WSGI is that, apart from the unit testing
   required to show the server stuff works, you do <em>not</em> need to test all of the
   application-savvy half via the HTTP server: instead the unit tests can just
   create an <code>environ</code> array, feed it to <code>HandleRequest</code>, and check the header list
   and body that result. This makes the unit tests a little less complicated (and
   probably makes them run faster, too).
</p>
<p>After a while patterns began to emerge in the top-half code. For example, a lot
   of the URL namespace managed by the server was split in to segments like
   <code>/static</code> (read from files on disc), <code>/boojums</code> (information about boojum called
   <code>fred</code> would be under URLs like <code>/boojums/fred/comments</code>). In the first iteration
   of the code, this was done using repetative code:
</p>
<pre><code>string path = (string) environ["PATH_INFO"];
if (path.StartsWith(’/static/’)) {
    string fileName = path.Substring(8);
    ... look for a file and return its conents ...
} else if (path.StartsWith(’/boojums/’)) {
    string rest = path.Substring(8);
    ... look for a boojum and return information about it ...
} ...
</code></pre><p>The began to get overly elaborate when I wanted the GUI to be able to add an
   extra URL path <code>/state</code>, that would tell the caller which was the current
   boojum, and knew I would need to add HTTP methods to update boojum properties as
   well as extract them.  So I spent Friday factoring out ‘middleware’ components. 
   Middleware is the WSGI term for an object that handles requests by invoking
   other request handlers—and doing a little bit of work in between. One example
   is class <code>Selector</code>, a simplified version of the Python <a href="http://lukearno.com/projects/selector/">WSGI Selector</a>.  The
   <code>Selector</code> class as an <code>Add</code> method you use to register handlers for parts of
   the URL namespace:
</p>
<pre><code>Selector selector = new Selector();
selector.Add("/static", "GET", new HandleRequestDelegate(
        new FileServer(dirName).HandleRequest));
selector.Add("/boojums", "GET", new HandleRequestDelegate(Boojums_GET));
selector.Add("/boojums", "POST", new HandleRequestDelegate(Boojums_POST));
InProcWebServer server = new InProcWebServer(
        new HandleRequestDelegate(selector.HandleRequest));
</code></pre><p>My selector is not yet as clever as the WSGI one: it does not extract URL
   parameters.  All it does is keep track of the <code>PATH_INFO</code> and <code>SCRIPT_NAME</code>
   entries in <code>environ</code>, shifting the matched portion across so that the inner
   request-handler thinks its namespace starts at <code>/</code>.
</p>
<p>There are two advantages to extracting the <code>Selector</code> class from the application
   code. First, it replaced a lot of repeatative ad-hoc switch and if statements
   with declarative code, which means, it reduces the amount of
   application-specific code by moving this functionality in to the generic class
   library (which might be reused on other projects). Second, my boojum
   class-library could supply the implementation of <code>/boojums</code>, and the GUI layer
   add another handler for <code>/state</code> without the class library needing to know about
   it.
</p>
<p>Similarly, we need a way to synchronize access to the database of boojums, since
   the database is not thead-safe. After a few false starts I settled on another
   middleware class, which has a member variable <code>handleRequest</code> set via its
   constructor, and a public member function <code>HandleRequest</code> method does whateber
   is necessary for synchronization and then calls the <code>handleRequest</code> delegate.
   When unit-testing the code, we cannot use the same synchronization code as we do
   in the GUI (because we use the magial method <code>Contol.Invoke</code>); spinning it out
   in to a separate middleware class allows us to test the rest of the code with a
   different synchronization technique.
</p>

<h2> Does it work?</h2>
<p>So far I have spent a week developing the web server and wiring it in to the
   application, and it has now reached the point where it works: the HTML page
   shown in the browser widget gets the current boojum’s address, and then gets the
   list of comments and displays them. It also displays a form that can be used to
   add a comment to the boojum. There are still some details to sort out (such as
   making the form appear when you click Add Comment, rather than having it clutter
   up the place all the time), but it is looking pretty good for a week’s effort.
