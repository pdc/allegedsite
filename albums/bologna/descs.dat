98ash:This is the street just outside the hotel we were at. I took this shot as a "typical" side street, narrow with a cloister-like arcade down one side.:
98asi:John (my boss) insisted that I get a picture with me in it.:
98asj:I loved the wacky crenelations on this building, and the contrast between the old grey stone and the bright orange bus -- and the great orange bus and the scooter.:
98asl:The caption on the immense poster reads "the United Colors of Beneton" -- presumably a caption in Italian would not seem controversial enough.:
98asm:Bicycle.:
98asn:Clock.:
98aso:I was trying for an interesting composition involving the two red children, but they wree moving about too quickly...:
98asp:Another side street, this time with an inexpolicable tower at the end.:
98asq:A tower at the end of a side street.:
98asr:The top of a tower in one of the side streets.:
98ass:As I hurried in to the meetoing in the morning, there was just enough mist to separate the statue of ?Nepune from the bassilica in the background. There are also two men cleaning the fountain.:
98ast:Another arcade on the way to the meeting.:
98asu:I snapped this one of the strength of the architecture of the building behind the bike racks.:
98asv:Return to the staute of (I assume) Neptune.:
98asw:Neptune's saucy sea-nymphs.  In case it isn't clear in the photo, they each have several streams of water issuing from between their fingers. What does this mean?:
98asx:The classical statue reaches out towards the modern building site.:
98asy:View fromout of the meeting room window.:
