mull2003,Mull Holliday (2003),Damian Cugley,http://www.flickr.com/photos/pdc/sets/72157600035611329/,"In September 2003, Jeremy and I visited my mother Jenny in her home in Tobermory on the Isle of Mull. This set’s a bit of a mixture—forest scenes from walking the dogs (my mother has 5–6 dogs in the house at a time, some of them borrowed from friends), or from visiting Aros Park on our own. There are some close-ups of little stuff as I tested the (super)macro lens on my digital camera.
